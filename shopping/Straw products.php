                    for a long time. The roofs of dwellings were covered with straw, she went to bedding for livestock,
                    shod and dressed a person, served as a bed, and in a lean year she was mixed into bread. Household
                    utensils, hats, toys and jewelry were made from it, and with skillful processing it can turn into
                    extraordinary works of art, as evidence of this - wicker straw iconostases - the royal gates, common
                    in our country since the end of the 18th century (everyone can admire these masterpieces those who
                    have visited the museums of the country).</p>
