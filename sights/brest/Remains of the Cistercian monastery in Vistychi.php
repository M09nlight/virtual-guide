                <h3>Remains of the Cistercian monastery in Vistychi</h3>
                <p class="text">The settlement has been known since 1471. In 1678, one of the representatives of the
                    well-known gentry family of Tyszkiewicz, Eustafiy, founded the monastery of the Cistercian order
                    here - this Catholic order was founded in 1098 in Burgundy (modern France). From the majestic
                    monastic complex, the building of the former church of St. Sophia has been preserved, since 1866 it
                    was transferred to the Orthodox Church and now operates as the Exaltation of the Cross Church.</p>

                <p class="text">Recently, when laying communications, a perfectly preserved underground passage was
                    discovered, the walls of which were reinforced with brickwork leading from the former monastery to
                    the Lesnaya River.</p>

                <p class="text">Nearby, a brick column of the Mother of God has been preserved, probably erected in the
                    1780s by Marcel Nemtsevich, the father of the famous writer and public figure Yulyan Nemtsevich,
                    secretary of the leader of the 1794 uprising, Tadeusz Kosciuszko.</p>

                <p class="text">In the village, significant fragments of the park have been preserved, which were once
                    part of the estate belonging to the gentry family of the Yagmins. A manor house was also located
                    here, in which many high-ranking persons stayed, including the Russian Emperor Alexander II.</p>
