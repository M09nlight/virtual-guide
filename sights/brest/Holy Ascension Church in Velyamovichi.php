                <h3>Holy Ascension Church in Velyamovichi</h3>
                <p class="text">In 1899, according to the project of I. Kalenkevich, the Holy Ascension Church was erected here. It is one of the largest in the Brest region. An apse adjoins the main rectangular volume from the east, a refectory and a three-tiered bell tower from the west. For a long time the temple was closed, destroyed, but already in the 2000s it was restored. Surprisingly, an Orthodox church of the same architectural design is located in ... Japan on the island of Hokkaido and was built in 1916 according to the project of Izo Kawamura. How it happened that both Orthodox churches are absolute architectural "twins" is still unknown. But in both churches, divine services are performed according to the Orthodox tradition, however, in the one located in Hakodate, they serve in Japanese. The abbots of the temples have established contact with each other.</p>
