                <h3>Ostrich farm in the village of Kozische</h3>
                <p class="text">Over 300 adults of the South African black ostrich live on a specialized farm founded in 2003 and located near the village of Kozische, Kobrin district, 20 kilometers from the regional center. The territory of the farm is about 50 hectares, the enclosures themselves occupy almost 10 hectares. This is the largest ostrich farm in the post-Soviet space, its potential is up to 1000 individuals kept at the same time. Before the start of the tour, visitors have the opportunity to visit the mini-zoo, where you can see exotic birds and animals and even feed them from your hand. Barbecue made from natural ostrich meat, as well as numerous souvenirs made from feathers and eggshells are very popular with tourists.</p>
