                <h3>Cathedral of Saint Simeon the Stylite</h3>
                <p class="text">St. Simeon Cathedral in Brest stands at the intersection of Masherov Ave. and st. K. Marx. Mentions of the Simeonovskaya church and monastery in ancient Brest date back to the 14th century. In it, before the construction of the existing church in the new city, the relics of the Monk Abbot Afanasy Filippovich, who was martyred in 1648, were kept. After the city was moved, in 1846 the first project for the construction of a new church was approved. There were no buyers at the auction for the construction of the temple, and therefore it was decided to carry out the work in an economic way within the amount allocated by the government. This led to a significant simplification of the project, which was approved in 1854.</p>

                <p class="text">The Cathedral of Simeon the Stylite in Brest is an architectural monument of the pseudo-Russian style. The building has a composition in the plan in the form of a centric cross: a powerful cuboid volume is raised on a high plinth made of pink granite and completed with a 5-cupola, among which a large 8-sided drum dominates. The entrance is solved by a keel-like perspective portal, above which is a niche of the same shape with the image of Simeon the Stylite. The facades are cut through with narrow arched window openings, girded with a profiled cornice and a parapet with triangular pediments.</p>

                <p class="text">In the interior, the light drum rests on 4 powerful pylons with arches. The aisle, narthex and apse are covered with cylindrical and cross vaults. In the hall, the choirs open up with a wide arched skylight. The interior is decorated with stencil ornaments. The apse is highlighted by an arched skylight and a wooden iconostasis.</p>
