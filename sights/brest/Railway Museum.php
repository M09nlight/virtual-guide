                <p class="text">On the open-air site, samples of railway equipment for a significant period of
                    development of the railways of Belarus were collected. The exhibits of the museum make it possible
                    to feel the power and beauty, uniqueness and significance of many ideas implemented in the creation
                    of railways, as well as get in touch with the past and truly appreciate the entire history of the
                    development and improvement of railway technology in different historical periods. Locomotives -
                    steam locomotives, diesel locomotives - are the basis for the development of the highway, the engine
                    of the country's economy, a symbol of a rapidly changing era and an important part of the destinies
                    of millions of people whose lives were connected with railway transport.</p>
