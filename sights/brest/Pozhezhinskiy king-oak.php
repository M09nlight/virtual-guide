                <h3>Pozhezhinskiy king-oak</h3>
                <p class="text">On the road P17 Brest - Kovel, near the sign for the village of Dubichno, Maloritsky district, we make a turn. Our goal is to see the oldest tree in Belarus - the Pozhezhin Tsar-oak. A tall and strong oak-giant is noticeable from afar, the direction will be prompted by signs. This tree is about 850 years old. Height - 46 meters, trunk diameter - more than 2 meters. Nearby grows an oak-patriarch, whose age is more than 660 years. A little further there are unique Pozhezhin spruce forests - a natural monument of republican significance. Commemorative plaques are installed near each of the trees, parking lots for tourists are equipped. The well-known artist Nikolai Seleschuk, the post-war Minister of Education of the BSSR Platon Saevich is from these places.</p>
