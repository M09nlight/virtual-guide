                <h3>Museum of Rescued Artifacts</h3>
                <p class="text">Perhaps this unusual institution, which is a branch of the Brest Regional Museum of
                    Local Lore, has no analogues in the world. In border Brest, local customs often confiscate valuables
                    when trying to illegally export them from the country. Among them are ancient icons, paintings,
                    jewelry and other items.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/30_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">When the collection of salvaged values reached an impressive size, the idea arose to
                    create a museum of rarities that could be lost forever for the country.</p>
                <p class="text">The opening of the museum took place in 1989 in an old mansion.</p>
                <p class="text">At first, the museum collection, which occupied 10 halls, consisted of about three
                    hundred valuable exhibits. Over time, the number of salvaged values has increased several times.
                    Today, the museum displays items exhibited in thematic sections. </p>
                <p class="text">Among them is a hall of antique furniture, jewelry, arts and crafts, Russian icons of
                    the 16th-17th centuries, portrait and landscape painting.</p>
