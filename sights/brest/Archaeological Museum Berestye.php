                <p class="text">The only museum in Europe of a medieval East Slavic city is located on the territory of the Brest Fortress, where ancient Berestye was born many centuries ago before its appearance. In 1968, at a depth of 4 meters, scientists discovered a craft quarter - dozens of wooden buildings of the 11th-13th centuries, street pavements and a palisade, the remains of adobe stoves. Today, in a unique museum, where a pavilion has been erected above the excavation of an ancient settlement, you can see archaeological finds of the 11th-14th centuries, telling about the life of the Slavic city, the development of crafts and trade, and the life of the inhabitants.
