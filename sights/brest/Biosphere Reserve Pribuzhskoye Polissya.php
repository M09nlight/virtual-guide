                <p class="text">Created in 2003 on the basis of the republican reserve of the same name, a year later received the official status of a UNESCO biosphere reserve. The area is over 48 thousand hectares. A distinctive feature of the landscapes of "Pribuzhsky Polesye" is the presence of dunes (sand hills) along the banks of rivers and lakes, some of them reach a height of up to 25 meters. The forests included in the reserve are rich in blueberries, blueberries, raspberries, lingonberries, as well as various types of mushrooms. Water bodies, especially ponds, are nesting and habitat for over 240 species (!) of birds, including the great heron, black stork, and others that are rarely found in nature. In the forests there are roe deer, wild boars, hares and other animals. There are more than forty species of fish in the reservoirs.</p>
