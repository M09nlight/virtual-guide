                <h3>Dubica Station</h3>
                <p class="text">The station building was built no later than 1887 and has been preserved in its original
                    form - the only one in Belarus of this scale. Thanks to this, in recent years, the Dubitsa station
                    has become an object of close interest of filmmakers - many episodes of the Russian films Cadets,
                    The Saga of the Khanty, Tungus. Sniper”, “Brest Fortress”, “Role”, “Hunting the Gauleiter” and
                    others. It is also important that unique "historical" steam locomotives from the museum, which is
                    located in Brest, can arrive at the station.</p>
