                <h3>BREST</h3>
                <p class="text">Brest- this is a cozy old Belarusian regional center, a city that just recently turned
                    1000 years old. At one time, the city was the center of the Berestey land and one of the most
                    important cities of Kievan Rus and the Galicia-Volyn principality. Brest was a "window to Europe"
                    for Rus' and a stronghold on the way to Kyiv. For a long time of its existence, Brest changed owners
                    more than once, was destroyed and rose from ruins. Picturesque parks, beautiful streets and
                    embankments, famous historical monuments, museums and temples - this is only a small part of what
                    this small Belarusian city is fraught with. We suggest you go on a trip right here - to the
                    south-west of Belarus.</p>
