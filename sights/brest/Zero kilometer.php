                    Brest region begins. Located opposite the Exaltation of the Cross Church on Lenin Square. It is a
                    milestone typical of Tsarist Russia, which depicts the coat of arms of the city, and on its base the
                    distances to the cities of Belarus are written.</p>

                <p class="text">There are always a lot of tourists near the milestone, who like to take pictures against
                    the background of this landmark of Brest and look for the distance to their city, written on the
                    base of the pillar.</p>
