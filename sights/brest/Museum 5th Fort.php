                <h3>Museum "5th Fort"</h3>
                <p class="text">There are 9 forts in Brest and its environs, one of which has now been turned into the
                    5th Fort Museum and is open to visitors. This unique defensive system was built and fortified in the
                    late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

                <p class="text">During the Great Patriotic War, the fort also took on the blow of enemy troops. The
                    museum dedicated to the history of the Brest fortifications was opened in the fort in 2000. Here you
                    can see the caponier, the barracks and the underground passage leading to it. There is an exhibition
                    of interesting documents in the barracks, and artillery pieces and military equipment are located on
                    the open-air platform.</p>
