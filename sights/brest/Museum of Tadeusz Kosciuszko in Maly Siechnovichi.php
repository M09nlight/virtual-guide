                <h3>Museum of Tadeusz Kosciuszko in Maly Siechnovichi</h3>
                <p class="text">One of the alleged birthplaces of Tadeusz Kosciuszko (the second alleged birthplace is the Merechevshchina farm near the town of Kossovo, Ivatsevichi district). Tadeusz Kosciuszko was born in 1746, brilliantly graduated from the Knights' School in Warsaw, trained in Paris, participated in the war of the North American states for independence (under his leadership, fortifications were built near Saratoga and at West Point, which played a huge role in the victory of the future US army over UK). In 1794 he led a national uprising in Poland, Belarus and Lithuania against the Russian Empire. He was wounded, imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress (St. Petersburg), released in 1796. The last years he lived in Switzerland, he died in 1817. His embalmed body was buried in the tomb of the kings and great heroes of Poland in the Wawel Castle in Krakow. Tadeusz Kosciuszko lived in Maly Sekhnovichi (Zhabinkovsky district) from 1784 to 1789. In the building of the former school, a museum named after him has been created, which has unique exhibits, in front of the museum there is a bust of T. Kosciuszko, the only one in Belarus. There are also remains of the old park.</p>
