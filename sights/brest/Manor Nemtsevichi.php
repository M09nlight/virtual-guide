                <h3>Manor Nemtsevichi</h3>
                <p class="text">In the small village of Skoky in the Brest region there is a unique architectural
                    monument of the 18th century - the family estate of the Nemtsevich gentry. For a long time the
                    estate was in disrepair and dilapidated. And now it is a luxurious building, turned into a
                    historical and memorial museum, which is called the Nemtsevich Manor.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/13_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The manor and park complex consisted of a palace, a park decorated in a regular style,
                    and outbuildings. The two-storey manor was built in the baroque style with pronounced features
                    inherent in it. In the old days, the rectangular building of the gentry's house had a tiled roof.
                    Thanks to the drawings of Napoleon Orda, it is known that outbuildings were located on the sides of
                    the building (servants lived in one of them, the second was reserved for stables), which formed a
                    semicircular courtyard typical of the 18th century in front of the entrance to the palace. Until our
                    time, these buildings have not survived.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/13_2.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Behind the house was a park covering an area of twenty-five hectares. All his paths led
                    to the Lesnaya River. Traditionally, opposite the estate there was a tomb of the Nemtsevich family,
                    which, like the outbuildings, has not been preserved.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/13_3.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Now the restored manor and park complex consists only of the palace itself and part of
                    the park. Despite this, the Nemtsevichy estate is one of the few buildings restored almost in its
                    original form. Due to the fact that at one time the architectural monument was included in the list
                    of historical and cultural values of Belarus, now we have the opportunity to enjoy the view of the
                    majestic renovated facades of the palace and see with our own eyes the restored interiors of the
                    gentry's house.</p>
                <p class="text">The Skokovsky palace and park ensemble is the only one on the territory of the Brest
                    region that is in such good condition, despite the fact that during its existence it has experienced
                    one complete evacuation, two total ruins, and has also been derelict for a long time. The threat of
                    an explosion hung over it, it could have been taken apart into stones, but the family nest of the
                    Nemtsevichs survived and now pleases the eyes of those traveling through the Brest region.</p>
