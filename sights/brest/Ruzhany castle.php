                <h3>Ruzhany castle</h3>
                <p class="text">The town of Ruzhany (today Pruzhany district, Brest region) was first mentioned in written sources at the end of the 15th century. It is known that until 1552 it belonged to the Tyszkiewicz family. In those days, Ruzhany was famous for the production of cloth and carpets, artistic belts, and ceramics. There were also big fairs.</p>

                <p class="text">In 1598, the Ruzhany estate was bought by the famous magnate and politician, chancellor, one of the authors of the unique set of laws - the Statute of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania - Lev Sapega. It was on his orders at the beginning of the 17th century that grandiose construction began here. A castle with three towers appeared in Ruzhany, combining the features of a defensive fortress and a grand palace.</p>

                <p class="text">In the 17th century, Ruzhany Castle was a significant center of political life in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. Many state issues were resolved here, receptions of ambassadors and kings were held.</p>

                <p class="text">Ruzhany Palace had the richest library and art gallery, one of the best theaters in Europe. 60 artists and 40 musicians played in his troupe, and many performances were staged in French. King Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski has been a spectator here more than once.</p>
                <p class="text">After the uprising of 1831, the Ruzhany possessions were confiscated, and the Sapiehas moved to another estate. The tenant merchant organized a weaving factory in the chambers of the palace, which worked here until the beginning of the 20th century.</p>
                <p class="text">During the First World War, the complex was again destroyed, but the Second World War caused the greatest damage to the palace. The main and eastern buildings, the entrance gate and outbuildings have been preserved.</p>
