                <p class="text">Maria Rodzevich was born in 1864, her parents were exiled to Siberia for helping the rebels of 1863. At the age of 23, she became the owner of the Grushevo estate (the current Kobrin district). She wrote stories and novels that, after being published, immediately gained immense popularity: “Terrible Grandfather”, “From the Wilderness”, “Devaitis” and others. In her works she sang of the beauty of Polissya and the work of local residents. The name of one of the stories was given by the centuries-old oak "Devaitis", which is still preserved in the former estate. In the village there are the remains of the writer's manor house, an adjacent park, a memorial sign has been erected in memory of the "song of Polesie", as her contemporaries called her.</p>
