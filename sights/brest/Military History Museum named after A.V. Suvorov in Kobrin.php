                <img src="../../images/brest/25_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Founded in 1946. The exposition was located in the manor house, where Alexander
                    Vasilyevich Suvorov, one of the outstanding commanders of Europe, lived in 1797 and 1800. The estate
                    "Kobrin Key" was presented to Suvorov for success in suppressing the uprising of 1794 on the
                    territory of Poland, Belarus and Lithuania, after which the 3rd partition of the Commonwealth took
                    place - as a result, the lands of modern Brest became part of the Russian Empire. In the early
                    1860s, Romuald Traugutt, one of the leaders of the anti-tsarist uprising of 1863-1864, lived in the
                    house, which later became a museum. Currently, there is an exposition entirely dedicated to A.V.
                    Suvorov. In 1995, next to the old mansion, a new museum building was opened, the exposition of which
                    is dedicated to the history of Kobrin and the Kobrin region as a whole. Nearby is the so-called.
                    "Suvorov Park".</p>
