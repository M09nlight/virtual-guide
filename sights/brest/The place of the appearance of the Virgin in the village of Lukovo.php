                <p class="text">In the village of Lukovo, Malorita district, there is a chapel located on a peninsula washed by the waters of Lake Lukovskoye. According to legend, once, during a terrible storm, when it seemed that the locals would die because of the rising huge waves, a young girl came out of the already dilapidated chapel and said: “Everyone who believes in God, follow me, I will save you! » When asked who she was, she replied: “Call me “Assuage my sorrows”. And in memory of the fact that I was with you, I will leave my mark ... ”After these words, she stepped on a boulder stone lying nearby, where the imprint of her bare foot remained. The trace on the stone is still preserved in the local Holy Nativity of the Theotokos Church.</p>
