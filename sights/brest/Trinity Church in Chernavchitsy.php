                <h3>Trinity Church in Chernavchitsy</h3>
                <p class="text">The representative of one of the most famous magnate families of the Commonwealth, Nikolai Christopher Sirotka, founded the Trinity Church in one of his estates in 1585. This was done in honor of his successful pilgrimage to the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem. Radziwill Sirotka entered the history of Belarusian memorial literature - he described his journey in a book that was first published in Latin in 1601 in Germany. On the pages of this book there is a mention of Chernavchitsy.</p>

                <p class="text">In addition to the church, the Orthodox Church of Paraskeva Pyatnitsa, built in 1733, also operates in the village. Some researchers claim that not a single metal nail was used in the construction of the temple. The most valuable example of Belarusian painting is kept in the temple - the icon â€œMiracle of St. George about the snake "(1729).</p>
