                <h3>Ruzhany castle</h3>
                <p class="text">The town of Kossovo (today Ivatsevichy district, Brest region) has been known since
                    1494, when the Grand Duke of Lithuania Alexander Yagielonchik presented these lands to Marshal Jan
                    Khreptovich.</p>
                <p class="text">For several centuries, Kossovo was owned by eminent dynasties: Khreptovichi, Sangushki,
                    Flemmings, Czartoryskis, Sapiehas. And in 1821 the estate was bought by Wojciech Puslovsky. He
                    founded a carpet factory in Kossovo, built or restored about 60 churches in the vicinity.</p>

                <p class="text">The Kossovo Palace is unique in its own way. The building consists of a central
                    two-story building and two side wings, and thanks to the faceted jagged towers, it is often called a
                    miniature castle.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/11_2.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Each tower symbolized the month of the year, while the 4 central ones - in honor of the
                    fruitful May, June, July and August - are the highest.</p>
                <img src="../../images/brest/11_3.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Rooms of the Kossovsky castle There are more than 100 rooms in the palace, and not a
                    single walk-through. Thanks to the system of corridors and the special arrangement of windows, for
                    two and a half days a year, sunlight completely flooded one of the chambers. At this time, the
                    owners celebrated the Day of the room, decorating it in a special way and spending a lot of time
                    there.</p>
                <p class="text">The Kossovo Palace was famous for its luxurious halls: in the White Palace the guests
                    danced at noisy balls, in the Black Palace they played cards, in the Pink Palace they played music.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Many legends are connected with the palace in Kossovo. Local residents said that for
                    protection, the owners kept a lion, which was released to roam the corridors at night.</p>
                <p class="text">They also remember the "musical" feature of the palace. If on the second floor of the
                    east side, standing on the windowsill, someone loudly clapped their hands, the vaults of the
                    building began to emit melodious sounds.</p>
