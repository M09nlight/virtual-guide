                    with barbed wire and swampy territory, on which there were no buildings like huts or dugouts. People
                    in any weather slept on the bare ground. The prisoners were starved, they were not given water, they
                    were forbidden to make fires. According to eyewitnesses, from 70 to 100 people died in the camp
                    every day.</p>
