                <h3>Temple of the Ascension</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of the Ascension of the Lord - built in 1890, closed in 1930. Since 1940, the church building has been used as a salt warehouse. During the Great Patriotic War, the Petrikov underground kept leaflets and a radio receiver in the building of the former temple, and also received and distributed reports from the Soviet Information Bureau. In the post-war years, the building was abandoned. In the 1970s, a beer bar was opened here, and in the 1980s, the Ice Cream Cafe was placed. In 1991, the church building was returned to Orthodox believers.</p>
