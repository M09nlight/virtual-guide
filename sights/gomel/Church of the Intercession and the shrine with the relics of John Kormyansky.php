                <h3>Church of the Intercession and the shrine with the relics of John Kormyansky</h3>
                <p class="text">In 1760, when the Polish magnates Chartariysky owned the village of Korma, the inhabitants built a wooden church in the name of the Intercession of the Mother of God, but by the end of the 19th century it had fallen into disrepair and could not accommodate all the parishioners. Then they decided to build a new church. Choosing a place for construction, the villagers turned to Father John Gashkevich, respected by all the surrounding people, for advice. He advised the rector of the parish, Archpriest Peter, to spend three days in fasting and prayer in order to find out the will of God about the place where the temple was to be built. The people heeded the advice of the priest, and soon a vision of burning candles began to appear in the center of the village in one place. A new temple in honor of the Intercession of the Most Holy Theotokos was built in 1897.</p>

                <p class="text">In recent years, the village of Korma has become known not only in Belarus, but also in Russia, Moldova, Ukraine. The beautiful, well-organized village is proud of its temple, where the incorruptible relics of St. John Kormyansky, who was canonized by the Orthodox Church in 1998 as a saint of the Belarusian land, rest.</p>
