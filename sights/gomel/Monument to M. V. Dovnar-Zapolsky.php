                <h3>Monument to M. V. Dovnar-Zapolsky</h3>
                <p class="text">Rechitsa is the birthplace of the outstanding historian and ethnographer, the "father" of Belarusian historiography Mitrofan Dovnar-Zapolsky. He set himself the task of proving that Belarusians are a full-fledged European nation, and Belarus is a country that has the right to independence and self-determination. His fundamental work "History of Belarus", published in 1925, but unpublished, caused criticism and became one of the reasons for the expulsion of the scientist from the BSSR. This work was published only 60 years after the death of the author - in 1994 in Belarusian, in Russian it was published nine years later.</p>
