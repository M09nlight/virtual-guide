                <h3>Church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in Korma</h3>
                <p class="text">In the 1990s, on the opposite side of the city, it was decided to build a church of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker in a retrospective Russian style. If you find yourself in Korma, also take a look at the Jewish cemetery, where stone tombstones with Hebrew inscriptions have been preserved. The spirit of antiquity is also preserved by pre-revolutionary houses, which can be seen in the center of the urban village. There is also a memorial sign dedicated to the villages that were resettled after the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.</p>
