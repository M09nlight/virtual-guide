                <h3>CHURCH OF SAINT NICHOLAS IN BRAGINA</h3>
                <p class="text">Perhaps the St. Nicholas Church existed in Bragin since the 17th century, but the exact time of its construction is unknown. In any case, the old temple in the urban settlement has not been preserved - it was destroyed in 1936.</p>

                <p class="text">A new church in Bragin began to be built in 1988. Outwardly, the brick church on Oktyabrskaya Street looks a bit like a residential building. The fact that this is an Orthodox shrine is indicated by three small domes on the roof of the building.</p>
