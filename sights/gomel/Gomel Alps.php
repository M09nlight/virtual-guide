                <h3>Gomel Alps</h3>
                <p class="text">On the western outskirts of Gomel there are real mountains, not much inferior to the
                    famous Soligorsk waste heaps. They were formed as a result of the activities of a chemical plant
                    that produces complex phosphorus-containing fertilizers. The resulting waste is stored on the
                    territory of the enterprise.</p>

                <p class="text">Over the decades of work, powerful dumps have formed, which are called the Gomel Alps
                    for their characteristic white color. Their mass today exceeds 20 million tons. Salt mountains in
                    Gomel consist mainly of phosphogypsum. The highest of them reach almost 100 meters. </p>
