                <p class="text">By a decree of the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection of Belarus, the outcrop "Loev" was declared a geological monument of republican significance. It is located in the cliff of the right bank of the Dnieper. Here, ancient lacustrine-swamp deposits came to the surface. The Loevsky fault of the Loevo-Donetsk depression is a unique section, the formation of which took place 135-110 thousand years ago. The outcrop was discovered in the 1920s. Its height is 18–20 meters. In its thickness, at a depth of 5–7 meters, more than a hundred species of plants (pollen, spores, seeds and fruits) were found.</p>
