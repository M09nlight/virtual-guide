                <p class="text">Upstream of the Pripyat, very close to Narovlya, there is an old floodplain oak forest. It looks especially impressive during spring floods, when the trees stand in the water. There are many oaks here, they are of different age and size.</p>

                <p class="text">The surrounding landscape with many oxbow lakes, floodplain meadows and blooming irises is also beautiful. In addition, bird lovers will certainly be pleased with the opportunity to meet one of the rarest species that nest in Belarus - garden bunting.</p>
