                <h3>Holy Trinity Church</h3>
                <p class="text">Not far from the ancient settlement stands the Holy Trinity Church. A bright
                    representative of the Neo-Gothic was built at the very beginning of the 20th century - in 1903.</p>

                <p class="text">At the same time, the history of the church in Rechitsa began in the distant 1634, when
                    the first Catholic parish in the city was opened. In 1756, a new temple was built from pine,
                    consecrated in honor of the Holy Trinity, and a Dominican monastery. At the beginning of the 19th
                    century, the brethren numbered almost two dozen monks.</p>
                <p class="text">Today the Holy Trinity Church is one of the main decorations of Rechitsa. The red brick
                    building is distinguished by strict integral plasticity. The church stands on a high plinth, the
                    side walls are separated by buttresses and characteristic gothic windows, which gives the temple
                    rhythm. The front side of the building is decorated with a white perspective portal. The massive
                    high belfry stands out in particular.</p>
