                <h3>Holy Intercession Church in the town of Streshin - an architectural monument of classicism</h3>
                <p class="text">This majestic temple was erected in 1807. According to some historical facts, the
                    construction of the temple was not without the participation of Count Osterman, who was granted the
                    place by the Russian Empress Catherine II. The church was famous for its frescoes, fine highly
                    artistic carvings of the iconostasis, picturesque canvases of the faces of the evangelists, mosaic
                    floors and paths that led to its main entrance. The heating system of the temple remains an unsolved
                    mystery for contemporaries. There are no radiators or stoves here, although even in the coldest
                    winter in the church you can stand in one thin shirt.</p>

                <p class="text">Along with the opening of the temple, chestnut trees were planted near it, which today
                    themselves have become a monument - a gray-haired legend that is more than two hundred years old.
                    Archival documents indicate that only 3 such buildings were erected in Europe, and only one has
                    survived to this day - the Holy Intercession Church in Streshin. The temple was destined to go
                    through many trials. The Church has withstood numerous wars that have swept through our land over
                    the past 200 years.</p>
