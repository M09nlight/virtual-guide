                <p class="text">More recently, the Polessky Radiation-Ecological Reserve was a completely closed territory, which only its employees and scientists could legally visit. However, in 2019, a course was taken to develop tourism, including such a direction as amateur fishing.</p>

                <p class="text">Tours allow not only to catch really large fish, which this section of the river abounds (but, alas, you wonâ€™t be able to take the trophy with you), but also to see with your own eyes the nature that was able to recover after a person was forced to leave this territory . Needless to say, the Pripyat floodplain is one of the most beautiful places not only in Belarus, but throughout Europe.</p>
