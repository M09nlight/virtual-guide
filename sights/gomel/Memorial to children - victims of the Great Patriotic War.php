                <h3>Memorial to children - victims of the Great Patriotic War (Red Coast)</h3>
                <p class="text">A monument-memorial of republican significance, dedicated to the memory of children -
                    victims of the war in the settlement. Krasny Bereg was designed by the creative workshop of the
                    Honored Architect of Belarus, laureate of the Lenin Prize L.M. Levin. Among the huge apple orchard,
                    the "Sun Square" was created - a monument that has no analogues in the CIS. </p>

                <p class="text">The basis for the
                    creation of the memorial was the true story of the tragic events of the Great Patriotic War. On the
                    territory of the educational farm Krasny Bereg, German troops created a collection point for
                    children aged 8 to 14, who were forcibly taken away from their mothers in Zhlobin, Rogachev, Dobrush
                    and other areas. At this point, the children underwent a medical examination, after which they were
                    sent to Germany as donors for wounded German soldiers and officers. In total, the Germans took away
                    1990 children for this purpose, including 15 children from the Krasnoberezhsky village council.</p>
