                <h3>Dobrush paper factory</h3>
                <p class="text">In 1870, Prince Paskevich "His Grace Prince Warsaw, Count Fyodor Ivanovich Paskevich
                    Erivansky" founded a stationery factory in Dobrush, which ranked first in the group of enterprises
                    of paper machines and printing products in Russia.</p>

                <p class="text">Initially, instead of the coarse mills that existed until that time, a wood-mass plant
                    was set up, which was driven by one hundred-horsepower turbine. The plant produced about 70 pounds
                    of wood pulp per day, the sale of which was difficult due to the lack of a railway and the absence
                    of stationery factories in the neighborhood. In 1871, the first paper machine and the necessary
                    machines for processing rags were installed. In 1872, the factory began to produce its first
                    products. In 1875, the second, and in 1895 - the third paper machines were installed. In 1878, paper
                    production was 180 pounds per day. It was low quality wrapping, writing and printing paper. In 1890,
                    the profit of the factory amounted to 900 thousand rubles, in 1900 - 1600 thousand rubles, and the
                    number of workers - 900 people.</p>
                    <p class="text">The Dobrush paper mill twice at Russian industrial exhibitions (Moscow, 1882, Nizhny Novgorod, 1892) was awarded the highest award - the right to place the state emblem of the Russian Empire on its products.</p>
