                <p class="text">Today in the reserve you can meet a bear, lynx, bison, Przewalski's horse and even a
                    turtle. Dozens of species of birds and plants listed in the Red Book.
                    Entry to its territory is strictly limited. It is impossible to get here without a special pass. An
                    experimental base has been created in the reserve, which includes a livestock farm, an orchard, an
                    apiary, and three woodworking production sites.

                <p class="text">Station "Masany" is the last point of the reserve. The Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant is
                    only 10 kilometers away. From here you can see the sarcophagus from the fire tower.</p>
