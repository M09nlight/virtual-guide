                <p class="text">Like any medieval city, Rechitsa had its own fortifications. On the right bank of the Dnieper, at the confluence with the Rechitsa River, there is an ancient settlement. This is a rectangular area with sides of 75 m by 45 m. The castle is fortified with almost two-meter ramparts, and from the north it is protected by a natural water barrier - there it is washed by the Dnieper. Also on both sides there are deep ditches, which in ancient times were filled with water.</p>

                <p class="text">At the end of the XIV century, when the city was in the possession of Prince Vytautas, a 5-tower castle "made of pine wood" was built for protection. The citadel performed its function for more than two centuries, until in 1654 itdid not burn the Cossack troops of Hetman Ivan Zolotarenko.</p>
