                <h3>House-Museum of Ivan Melez</h3>
                <p class="text">Many personal items were inherited from Ivan Melezh in the Museum House. By the way, it was built after the death of the writer, since the parental house was sold, and the former owners did not agree to give the house away.</p>
                <img src="../../images/gomel/114_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Among the unique exhibits are a desk, a hat, a watch, a briefcase and first editions of famous works. Including "People in the swamp." The Underwood typewriter, on which Melezh printed his immortal masterpiece of Belarusian literature, the Polissya Chronicle, was forever “registered” here. And most importantly - photographs of Ivan Melez himself - in childhood, youth, and adulthood. It is interesting to consider them.</p>
