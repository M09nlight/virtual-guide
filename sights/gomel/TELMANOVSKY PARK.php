                <h3>TELMANOVSKY PARK</h3>
                <p class="text">The main attraction of the Bragin district is located in the village of Telman -
                    fragments of the castle of the Vishnevetsky princes and Telmanovsky park, a classic example of
                    garden and park architecture of the 18th century.</p>

                <p class="text">The village of Telman has been known since the 18th century, and its first mention is
                    connected precisely with the fact that a park was laid in the village. It diverged from the castle
                    in three directions in wide alleys. Their landscapes are still striking in their splendor. But the
                    castle, unfortunately, almost did not survive. Only part of the foundation remained from it.</p>
                <p class="text">An interesting fact is connected with the castle. Here, at the beginning of the 17th
                    century, the fugitive monk Grishka Otrepiev lived, who called himself Tsarevich Dmitry, and later
                    became known as False Dmitry I. Another attraction of the park reminds of him - a stone in the shape
                    of a heart, which is called the "stone of love". According to legend, the future False Dmitry and
                    Marina Mnishek once declared their love near him.</p>
