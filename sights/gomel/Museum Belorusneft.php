                <h3>Museum "Belorusneft"</h3>
                <p class="text">More than half a century ago, an oil field was discovered in the vicinity of Rechitsa,
                    and two years after this landmark event - in 1966 - the Belorusneft association appeared. Today, the
                    work of most of the population of the city is one way or another connected with the extraction of
                    minerals. It was in Rechitsa that the history of the Belarusian oil industry began.</p>
                <img src="../../images/gomel/96_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">In honor of the 100 millionth ton of black gold lifted at Belorusneft in 1998, a gallery
                    of labor glory of the enterprise was opened. It was equipped at the Neftyanik Palace of Culture and
                    Technology. Over the years, the museum has been reconstructed three times, the last time - in honor
                    of the 55th anniversary of the discovery of oil deposits near Rechitsa.</p>
                <p class="text">Today, the gallery provides visitors with documents, photographs, miniature copies of various objects of the enterprise: a drilling rig, a "rocking chair", a solar power plant (by the way, the largest in the country!), a gas station, etc. The premises of the Palace of Culture do not accommodate all the exhibits accumulated over five decades. Therefore, many of them have been transferred to a virtual format and are shown on special multimedia panels.</p>
