                <h3>Chapel of St. Euphrosyne of Polotsk</h3>
                <p class="text">The dominant of the Dnieper embankment and one of the most recognizable sights of Rechitsa is the chapel of St. Euphrosyne of Polotsk. Initially, it was called Jubilee, since the creation of the monument was dedicated to several significant dates at once - the 1000th anniversary of the Baptism of Rus', the 50th anniversary of the Victory in the Great Patriotic War. In addition, it was erected in memory of the soldiers-internationalists, victims of the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant. But the name in honor of the legendary Belarusian saint was established among the people.</p>

                <p class="text">The place for the construction of the chapel was not chosen by chance. In 1910 steamships were sailing through Rechitsa along the Dnieper, carrying the relics of the heavenly intercessor of BelarusSaint Euphrosynefrom Kyiv "home" - to my nativePolotsk. The shrine with the holy remains was carried ashore, then the tomb was brought to the Holy Assumption Cathedral, and in the morning the relics were returned to the ship. Then, on the bank of the river, where ships with sacred cargo moored, an oak cross was placed as a sign of a sacred place. Much later, in 1995, a memorial chapel was built here.</p>
