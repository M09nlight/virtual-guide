                <p class="text">The city of thirteen bridges is called Dobrush. The beautiful Iput breaks into numerous
                    branches, forming islands and creeks that wrap around our city with openwork lace. And bridges,
                    large and small, connect the microdistricts of the city into one whole. Such a number of bridges,
                    which is in Dobrush, is almost never found in small, quiet towns like ours.</p>
