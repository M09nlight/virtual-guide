                <h3>Sozh</h3>
                <p class="text">The Sozh flows through the entire region - one of the few large rivers in Belarus, which has remained in a state close to natural. Along its banks, water meadows have been preserved, as well as majestic oak forests, which are flooded during spring floods. To preserve these natural resources, the Sozha floodplain reserve was created.</p>

                <p class="text">Rafting can be an alternative to walking along it. This is a great way to see the breathtaking landscapes that stretch out on both banks, and at the same time feel the romance of a water trip. In any case, the Sozh is worth experiencing at least once the beauty of this river, and the best place to do it is in the Vetka district.</p>
