                <h3>Turovsky Meadow </h3>
                <p class="text">Hundreds of foreign tourists visit Turov every year to see rare bird species that live both in the city itself and in its environs. Among them are the morodunka (the only monument to this sandpiper in the world is located on the central square of the city), the blue tit and others.</p>

                <p class="text">The floodplain meadow adjacent to Turov from the north turns into a whole archipelago every spring. Many birds stop here during seasonal migrations, some of them stay to hatch their chicks. In April, you can witness how a flock of 20-30 thousand turukhtans soar into the sky, literally obscuring it. Various species of terns and ducks nest on the Turov Meadow, and there is a great snipe lek nearby, which is well known not only to Belarusian photographers.</p>
