                <h3>Dnieper</h3>
                <p class="text">This legendary river, which from time immemorial has played an important role in the
                    life of the Slavic peoples, crosses the entire Rogachev region, the city itself was founded in the
                    place where the Drut flows into it. At the same time, the Dnieper is not just a part of the national
                    culture, it is also famous for its natural resources.</p>

                    Suffice it to say that vast floodplain meadows have been preserved in the floodplain of this river,
                    which serve as a home for many rare species. However, even those who are not interested in watching
                    wild animals will certainly not remain indifferent to this river with its numerous oxbow lakes,
                    floodplain oak forests and breathtaking expanses.
