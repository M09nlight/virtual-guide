                <h3>Ancient settlement</h3>
                <p class="text">Today it is difficult to imagine that Turov is one of the most ancient Belarusian cities, whose history goes back more than 1000 years. Today it does not have the status of a regional center, which it lost in 1962, and once this city was the capital of an independent principality, which gave the world several prominent religious and political figures.</p>

                <p class="text">However, the Turov settlement is a wonderful reminder of the glorious past. During the excavations, it was possible to discover the foundation of the cathedral, which at one time was one of the largest stone buildings of Ancient Rus'. Oddly enough, it was destroyed by an earthquake.</p>
