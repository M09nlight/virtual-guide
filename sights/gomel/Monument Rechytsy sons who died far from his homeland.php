                <h3>Monument "Rechytsy sons who died far from his homeland"</h3>
                <p class="text">On the alley of Warriors-Internationalists there is a poignant memorial "Rechytsy to the sons who died far from homeland". Seven storks with folded wings dive hopelessly one after another into the crack between the granite stones. These birds embody the image of the natives of Rechitsa, who fell in battles during various military conflicts far beyond the borders of their native country. First of all, in Afghanistan: according to the idea of the creators, boulders are a symbol of Islamic fundamentalism. The monument reaches 7.5 meters in height, it stands in the center of a concrete platform. The author of the project was Eduard Agunovich, the sculptural composition is the result of the work of Vladimir Slobodchikov.</p>
