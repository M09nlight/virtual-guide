                <h3>CHURCH OF THE INTERCESSION</h3>
                <p class="text">The Intercession Church, which combines the traditions of folk architecture with elements of a retrospective Russian style, is a modern interpretation of the Gothic.</p>

                <p class="text">Intercession Church in Oktyabrsky was built in 1996. It is located on the southern outskirts of the district center, next to the cemetery. The appearance of this red brick building is determined by the features of the retrospective Russian style.</p>
                <p class="text">Attention is drawn to the faceted wooden drum above the main volume, topped with a hipped roof. The architectural ensemble also includes a rubble stone fence and a gate in the form of a triple arch with semi-columns and an openwork forged lattice.</p>
