                <h3>Transfiguration Church</h3>
                <p class="text">This temple makes an equally strong impression on those who see it for the first time.

                <p class="text">The result of this bold experiment was an elegant temple, which can pleasantly surprise even those who consider themselves an expert in religious architecture. Together with the town hall and old houses of pre-revolutionary construction, it allows you to feel the atmosphere that reigned here in the 19th century, when the city was in its heyday.</p>
