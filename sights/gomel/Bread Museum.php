                <h3>Bread Museum</h3>
                <p class="text">In the agricultural town of Botvinovo there is a Bread Museum. It presents various items that are somehow connected with the production of this most important product: from sowing a field to baking a loaf. All of them were donated by local residents.</p>

                <p class="text">A visit to this museum also includes an acquaintance with the work of folklore groups that perform songs and demonstrate local rituals. Still, the most attractive part is the opportunity to participate in a master class on baking bread, as well as tasting various products prepared according to old recipes.</p>
