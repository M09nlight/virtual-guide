                <h3>Palace and park ensemble in Narovlya</h3>
                <p class="text">Estates that once belonged to representatives of the Gorvatt family can be seen in various parts of Eastern Polissya. However, the complex in Narovlya noticeably surpasses them in scope. The manor began to be built in the middle of the 19th century, when classicism dominated in architecture.</p>

                <p class="text">This is clearly seen in the appearance of the palace, which is characterized by symmetry. Unfortunately, many of the facade decorations have been lost. The building is clearly waiting for restoration, like the rest of the buildings that are part of this complex. So far, only the gazebo-lighthouse has been restored to its former splendor. Still, it is worth recognizing that the ruins of the fountain give the landscape park, which was laid out on the high bank of the Pripyat, a touch of romance.</p>
