                <h3>Art Gallery of Alexander Isachev</h3>
                <p class="text">The fate of one of the most mysterious artists of Belarus of the 20th century, Alexander Isachev, is connected with Rechitsa. The future master was born in the village of Ozarichi (Kalinkovichi district) on January 11, 1955. He moved to Rechitsa with his mother at the age of three.</p>

                <p class="text">The talent of the artist manifested itself in childhood. Alexander received his first mastery lessons in Mozyr, then in Minsk at a specialized school for gifted children. After four years of study, he was expelled for violating the rules - he dyed his hair red. At the age of 18, Isachev left for Leningrad, where he joined the avant-garde artists. Then his original style took shape in the technique of glazing writing.</p>
