                <p class="text">Before reaching a few kilometers to the main entrance to Khoiniki, on the left, near the car camping, a pine tree with a special status, the Queen, grows. Its fluffy branches unanimously stretch towards the sun, and the crown resembles a royal headdress.</p>

                <p class="text">In January 1998, the pine was given the status of a local monument. The tree was fenced off, and a sign was installed next to it explaining what kind of unique tree it was, a bridge and a special path were added. Although she is not red, she looks very regal.</p>
