                <h3>Pirevichi Church of All Saints (village Pirevichi)</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of All Saints is one of the most beautiful and majestic in Belarus. Built of red
                    brick, it attracts the eye of any traveler from afar. The inner area of the temple is almost 500
                    square meters, the thickness of the walls is more than one meter. Here is the largest altar in the
                    Gomel diocese, perfect acoustics. Built in 1902 in the neo-Russian, or “Moscow” style, the Pirevichi
                    Church is one of the architectural monuments of Belarus. It has an elongated cruciform composition,
                    which is dominated by a huge cube of the prayer hall, decorated with a parapet of kokoshniks and
                    crowned with a two-tiered domed drum. The main expenses for the construction of the church were
                    borne by the local landowner, the widow of the Privy Councilor Alexander Alekseevich Rogovich. She
                    also allocated land for the temple. Divine services began here on June 6, 1903. After the war,
                    service was restored in the church. And only in the 1990s, the Pirevichi temple experienced its
                    second birth: the bell tower was restored, and a major overhaul was carried out.</p>
