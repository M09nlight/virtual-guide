                <h3>House of Merchant Groshikov</h3>
                <p class="text">The building in which it is housed is an important landmark in itself. We are talking about the former house of the merchant Groshikov, which was built at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries in the Art Nouveau style. Inside, there are icons, samples of applied art and other items that will help you learn more about who the Old Believers really were and what mark they left in Belarusian culture.</p>
