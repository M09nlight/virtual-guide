                <h3>CHURCH OF THE KAZAN ICON OF THE MOTHER OF GOD IN KALINKOVICHI</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of St. Nicholas, which adorned the center of Kalinkovichi in pre-revolutionary
                    times, with the advent of Soviet power, was turned into a warehouse and significantly rebuilt. Now
                    this building is occupied by the House of Children's Creativity, so it was decided to build a new
                    temple near the intersection of Kuibyshev and Pionerskaya streets. This is how the Church of Our
                    Lady of Kazan appeared in Kalinkovichi. It was consecrated on November 4, 1993.</p>

                <p class="text">The appearance of this temple is distinguished by features characteristic of the
                    retrospective Russian style. A dome rises above the main volume on a faceted drum, surrounded by
                    four onion cupolas, the fifth is located above the entrance. The windows are framed with ornate
                    platbands. The architectural ensemble of this temple also includes a two-tiered bell tower.</p>
