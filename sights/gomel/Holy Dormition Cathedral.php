                <h3>Holy Dormition Cathedral</h3>
                <p class="text">Very close to the Holy Trinity Church is the main Orthodox church of Rechitsa - the Holy Assumption Cathedral. This is one of the oldest buildings in the city, but its fate was in jeopardy. Construction began in 1842, but the work did not work out - a year later, the erected bell tower suddenly collapsed on the temple. The almost finished building was destroyed almost to the ground. Construction resumed only two decades later - in 1864. And thirty years after the start of work, the new temple was finally consecrated.</p>

                <p class="text">Since 1917, the clergy were gradually liquidated in Rechitsa. After 17 years, the cathedral was closed, and the most valuable church utensils were confiscated. Later, the religious building was occupied by the House of Socialist Culture. As unnecessary, the belfry and the bulb of the dome were demolished, the interior was completely changed, the second floor was built on, where the city library worked. A wooden outbuilding was built next to the temple. In 1940, during a fire, the complex was seriously damaged. The following year, believers made repairs on their own and resumed services. In the 1960s, the Rechitsa House of Culture moved to a building specially built for it. The abandoned cathedral began to collapse.</p>
                <p class="text">Only at the very end of the 20th century the building was returned to the Orthodox parish. Restoration began, and in 2003 the renovated Holy Assumption Cathedral was consecrated. The bell tower was restored in 2007.</p>
                <p class="text">The cathedral is an example of late classicism. In terms of the plan, the temple has the shape of a cross, at the base is a prayer hall, which is covered with a tent with an onion dome and dormer windows. The pride of the Holy Assumption Cathedral is a five-tiered iconostasis, consisting of 24 images. In 2011, the church was replenished with two icon cases - with the face of St. Nicholas the Wonderworker and with the icon of the Kazan Mother of God.</p>
