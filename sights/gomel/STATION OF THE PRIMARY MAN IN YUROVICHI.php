                <h3>STATION OF THE PRIMARY MAN IN YUROVICHI</h3>
                <p class="text">According to archaeological data, a man settled on the site of modern Yurovichi about 26
                    thousand years BC. This is evidenced by the oldest site of primitive man on the territory of
                    Belarus, discovered by scientists in 1929 on the high bank of the Pripyat.</p>
                <img src="../../images/gomel/48_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The settlement existed for several millennia, until the advancing glacier forced people
                    to leave for warmer climes, but they returned as soon as the glacier receded. During excavations,
                    archaeologists discovered oval-shaped dwellings 4-6 meters long at the Yurovichi site. The frames
                    for these "houses" were built from long bones covered with skin, and their lower part was reinforced
                    with animal skulls, stones, large bones dug into the ground. In Yurovichi, bones of mammoths, a
                    primitive bull, a wild horse, as well as stone tools were found: lamellar knives, piercers,
                    scrapers.</p>
