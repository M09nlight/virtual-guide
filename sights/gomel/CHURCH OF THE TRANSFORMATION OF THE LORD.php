                <h3>CHURCH OF THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE LORD</h3>
                <p class="text">The Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Svetlogorsk dates back to 1995. It was then that the Orthodox parish of the same name was registered. However, for a long time, services were held in the prayer house. Construction work began in 1998, and on September 17, 2006, the new temple, which has the shape of a cross, was consecrated.</p>

                <p class="text">It belongs to the retrospective-Russian style. This is indicated by such typical architectural elements as zakomara and arched windows. The five-dome composition refers to the traditions of ancient Russian architecture. On the territory of the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord in Svetlogorsk there is also a chapel dedicated to the icon of the Mother of God "Life-Giving Spring".</p>
