                <h3>Krinitsa in the village of Selets</h3>
                <p class="text">Near the village of Selets there is a spring, which has long been considered holy among the locals, and its water is healing. Many pilgrims flocked here during the Christian holidays. This tradition is still alive today. Many come just to get water, which is of high quality, or to communicate with nature.</p>
