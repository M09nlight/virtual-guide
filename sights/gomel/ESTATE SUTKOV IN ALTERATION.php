                <h3>ESTATE "SUTKOV" IN ALTERATION</h3>
                <p class="text">Since the 17th century, most of the Loevshchina with the surrounding lands and forests, including Sutkov and Peredelka, was the hereditary possession of the Yuditsky family. For centuries, it was inherited within the family. The husband of one of the heirs at the beginning of the 19th century built a manor and park complex in the Sutkovsky estate. Later, the estate was sold to Count A.I. Baranovsky. Its last owner was Countess E.V. Baranovskaya, who devoted a lot of energy to the creation of a multi-structural economy.</p>

                <p class="text">After the October Revolution of 1917, the Baranovskaya family emigrated to Canada, but a good memory of her has been preserved in Loyevshchina to this day. The former estate now houses the Sutkovsky kindergarten - a secondary school.</p>
