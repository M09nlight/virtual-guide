                <h3>HOLY CROSS CHURCH</h3>
                <p class="text">Holy Cross Church in Svetlogorsk is located on the banks of the Berezina. The first mention of a Catholic church on the territory of this settlement, which was then called Shatilki, dates back to the middle of the 17th century. Since then, it has been rebuilt several times. The modern red brick building appeared in 1997.</p>

                <p class="text">The author of the project was the architect Sergei Pevny. The Exaltation of the Cross Church in Svetlogorsk can be considered as an example of neo-Gothic with elements of the Romanesque style. The main decoration of the facade and the most noticeable architectural element are two high towers with hipped roofs.</p>
