                <p class="text">Polissya is famous for its folk kinship traditions, which were most clearly manifested during the construction of wooden temples. Some of them claim to be included in the UNESCO World Heritage List. In any case, each region has created its own unique school, and the Gomel region is no exception.</p>

                <p class="text">Against the general background, the Church of St. Nicholas in Staraya Belitsa. This temple dates back to the 18th century (the exact time of construction is still disputed, but 1710 is most often mentioned). That is why in its appearance there are features of baroque. It is impossible not to mention the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin in Glybotsky and the Old Believer Church of St. Ilya in Gomel. Both temples are over 200 years old. </p>
