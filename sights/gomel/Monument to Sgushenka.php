                <p class="text">This product, without exaggeration, is a real symbol of the Rogachev region. Local condensed milk, made “according to the same recipe”, is exported to many countries where it is well known and loved. For many Belarusians, this is a real taste of childhood.</p>

                <p class="text">It is understandable that many would like to see how the legendary product is born. Such an opportunity is provided to those lucky ones who will become participants in an excursion to the Rogachev Dairy Plant, which produces condensed milk, which has glorified the region far beyond the borders of Belarus.</p>
