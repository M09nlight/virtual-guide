                <h3>HORWATT MANOR IN LIPOW</h3>
                <p class="text">The Gorvatts manor in Lipov appeared in the middle of the 19th century. Its main decoration is still a two-story manor house, the construction of which was completed in 1862. Above the main entrance is a triangular pediment. This and other architectural elements are characteristic of neoclassicism.</p>

                <p class="text">The park, which belongs to the landscape type, has also been preserved. When it was created, natural plantings were taken as a basis, to which many exotic plants were added. Some of the trees here are over 100 years old. The park is a great place for walking.</p>
