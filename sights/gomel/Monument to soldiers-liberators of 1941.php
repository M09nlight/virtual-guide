                <h3>Monument to soldiers-liberators of 1941 (Zhlobin)</h3>
                <p class="text">In Zhlobin there is a place especially revered by every inhabitant of the city and the
                    region - the Liberators Square.</p>
                <p class="text">
                    In the center of the square there is an obelisk to the soldiers of the 63rd Rifle Corps under the
                    command of General Leonid Grigoryevich Petrovsky, who on July 13, 1941, having crossed the Dnieper,
                    inflicted a powerful blow on the enemy, knocked him out of Zhlobin and threw him more than 30
                    kilometers to the west.</p>
                <img src="../../images/gomel/41_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">With their heroic and skillful actions, the divisions of the 63rd Rifle Corps halted the
                    enemy offensive in the Gomel direction for almost a month and a half. This made it possible for
                    Gomel to evacuate industrial facilities, material values and the population to the east. Thus, the
                    offensive against Moscow was slowed down, which made it possible to gain time for organizing the
                    defense in depth of the Soviet capital and was invaluable in disrupting the lightning-fast end of
                    the war planned by the German command.</p>
