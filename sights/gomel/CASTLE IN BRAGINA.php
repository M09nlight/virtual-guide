                <h3>CASTLE IN BRAGINA</h3>
                <p class="text">Historians disagree when Bragin acquired his own castle, which played an important role
                    as a border fortification. It is reliably known that its construction was carried out by the
                    Vishnevetsky princes.</p>

                <p class="text">This noble family owned the Bragin castle until its destruction in the 17th century.
                    During its existence, it managed to serve as the residence of False Dmitry I. Today, only an
                    approximate place is known where the fortification was located. Archaeological excavations have not
                    been carried out in this area.</p>
