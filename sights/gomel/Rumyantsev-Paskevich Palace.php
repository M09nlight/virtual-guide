                <p class="text">This majestic palace and park ensemble is a visiting card not only of the district, but of the entire region. This is a striking example of classicism, which has been perfectly preserved to this day (largely due to the fact that the building housed a museum).</p>

                <p class="text">Now tourists have the opportunity to see how the representatives of the Russian aristocracy lived, who owned this estate, as well as the surrounding lands. A real decoration of the old park is the chapel-tomb in a retrospective Russian style.</p>
