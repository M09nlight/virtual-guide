                <h3>King-pine</h3>
                <p class="text">This is the name of one of the most popular tourist routes laid through the territory of the Pripyatsky National Park. Walking along it is perhaps the best way to get acquainted with the nature of this region. You will see oaks aged 100-200 years, and a picturesque forest stream flowing among blooming calla, and much more.</p>

                <p class="text">The ultimate goal is a pine tree that is estimated to be between 350 and 500 years old. The tree is really striking in its size. An additional color is given to it by huge boards suspended high above the ground. Along the way, bird lovers can expect to encounter interesting species such as the white-throated flycatcher and the three-toed woodpecker.</p>
