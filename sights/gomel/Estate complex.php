                <h3>Estate complex</h3>
                <p class="text">In the village of Khalch there is one of the most significant monuments of the classicism era in the Belarusian lands - the Voynich-Senozhetsky estate. In fairness, it should be noted that at the end of the 18th century, representatives of a different kind, the Khaletskys, began to build it. However, because of the support given to Napoleon, they lost their property, which was sold to other owners.</p>

                <p class="text">An interesting feature of this estate is that its second floor, in order to save money, was built of wood, but at the same time it was plastered to “splurge”. The new owners were Freemasons, and therefore converted one of the premises for the meetings of this secret society. After the completion of the restoration, the Voynich-Senozhetsky estate should appear in its former splendor.</p>
