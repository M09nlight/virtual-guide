                <h3>Round Lake</h3>
                <p class="text">There is a lake 20 km southwest of Gomel, which has such a regular round shape that it has given rise to a whole wave of theories. According to one of them, during the Second World War, a nuclear weapon was allegedly tested here, according to another, this reservoir was formed as a result of a meteorite fall.</p>

                <p class="text">The nearby village with the unusual name Guiding Star only makes the Mikhailovsky reservoir (this is the name of this lake) mysterious, providing room for imagination. Come here to come up with your own explanation or just to admire the picturesque shores, which are really round in shape.</p>
