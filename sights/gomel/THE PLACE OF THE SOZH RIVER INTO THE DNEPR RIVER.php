                <h3>THE PLACE OF THE SOZH RIVER INTO THE DNEPR RIVER</h3>
                <p class="text">The place where the Sozh flows into the Dnieper is rightfully considered one of the most
                    beautiful corners of Polissya. The hill offers a breathtaking view of both rivers and the
                    surrounding landscape, which was declared a republican reserve (it is called “Dnepro-Sozhsky”).</p>

                <p class="text">Old pine and oak forests, river terraces, as well as floodplain meadows have been
                    preserved here. This combination of biotopes creates excellent conditions for the habitat of various
                    rare species listed in the Red Book of Belarus. The mouth of the Sozh is one of the places that
                    every nature lover should visit at least once.</p>
