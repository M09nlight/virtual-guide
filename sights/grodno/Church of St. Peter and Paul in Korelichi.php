                <h3>Church of St. Peter and Paul in Korelichi</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of St. Peter and Paul in Korelichi was erected in 1866. However, later this temple was repeatedly rebuilt, so that its original appearance, which combines features of different styles (retrospective Russian, classicism, etc.), also underwent changes.</p>

                <p class="text">Church of St. Peter and Paul in Korelichi has the shape of a cross. The most notable element is the octagonal drum located above the main volume of the building and decorated with a dome that appeared later. It is crowned with an onion head. In the 1960s and 70s, serious restoration work was carried out in the temple, during which the iconostasis was also replaced.</p>
