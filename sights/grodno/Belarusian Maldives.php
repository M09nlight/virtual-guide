                <h3>"Belarusian Maldives"</h3>
                <p class="text">The real pearl of this region, as well as the entire Grodno region, are flooded quarries located near the village of Krasnoselsky. Thanks to the picturesque white shores and the unusual color of the water, which, depending on the lighting, is bright blue or green, this place has already been called the Belarusian Maldives.</p>

                <p class="text">Until recently, visiting quarries for safety reasons was prohibited. But in connection with the expansion of the visa-free zone in the Grodno region, sightseers in organized groups will be allowed into comfortable places for photo shoots against the backdrop of chalk quarries. But this will not affect those who want to visit careers spontaneously.</p>
