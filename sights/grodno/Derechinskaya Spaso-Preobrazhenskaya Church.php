                <h3>Derechinskaya Spaso-Preobrazhenskaya Church</h3>
                <p class="text">An architectural monument of the Byzantine style in the village of Derechin, Zelvensky
                    district, Grodno region. Built in 1863 of brick. This majestic, even huge by village standards,
                    temple stands just at the crossroads of Slonim-Zelva and simply attracts people's eyes. It makes
                    passers-by wonder and admire.
                    The Church of the Transfiguration of the Savior was built with five wooden domes. The middle part of
                    the temple, with two side doors, is a regular quadrangle with four columns, on which the middle dome
                    with eight windows is approved. In the vestibule there is a baptismal room and a passage to the
                    upper kliros and the bell tower.
