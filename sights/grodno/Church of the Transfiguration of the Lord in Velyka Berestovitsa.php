                <p class="text">A special decorative effect is created by the polychrome masonry of the walls, which is combined with plastered decorative elements: spatulas, cornices, etc. The side facades are decorated with lancet windows. Starting from 1965, the building was used as a warehouse, and only at the very end of the Soviet era was it returned to believers. After the restoration of the Church of the Transfiguration of the Lord, divine services were resumed.</p>
