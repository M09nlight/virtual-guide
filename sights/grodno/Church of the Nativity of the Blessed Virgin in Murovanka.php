                <h3>Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin in Murovanka</h3>
                <p class="text">In the village of Murovanka, there is the Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, built at the beginning of the 16th century (although some researchers believe that it may be a whole century older). One glance is enough to understand how unusual this temple is, which rather resembles a small medieval castle.</p>

                <p class="text">The Church of the Nativity of the Virgin was really built in such a way that, if necessary, it could be used as a military fortification. This explains the presence of towers and loopholes. Today, this building is perceived simply as a romantic fusion of Gothic castle architecture with Renaissance elements.</p>
