                <h3>Church of the Intercession in Turets</h3>
                <p class="text">The Church of the Intercession in Turets, whose construction was carried out from 1886 to 1888, belongs to the retrospective Russian style, like most Orthodox churches that were built on the territory of Belarus in the second half of the 19th century (they are also commonly called "ants").</p>

                <p class="text">At the same time, the Church of the Intercession in Turets is distinguished by a more complex composition. So the bulbous dome above the main volume is surrounded by four more smaller ones, mounted on light drums. Additional picturesqueness to this temple is given by the use of rubble stone, from which the walls are made, in combination with plastered decorative elements.</p>
                <p class="text">Some of them date back to ancient Russian architecture, including hanging double arches that adorn the portals of the vestibules, kokoshniks. The interior of the temple is decorated with a gilded carved iconostasis made at the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. It is also worth noting that even in Soviet times, the Church of the Intercession in Turets remained active.</p>
