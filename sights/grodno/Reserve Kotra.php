                <p class="text">The northern part of the Shchuchinsky district is covered with dense forest. The reserve "Kotra" was created on this territory, but in the past it was a place of grand ducal and royal hunting. Particularly picturesque places are located around Lake Bershtovskoe. It was here that the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania took place, at which Grodno was granted Magdeburg rights.</p>

                <p class="text">Lovers of untouched nature will love these places. The river Kotra is especially popular. The route passing through it is well known to water tourists. It provides, perhaps, the best opportunity to visit these hard-to-reach, but such beautiful places.</p>
