                                <p class="text">It was built of red brick at the beginning of the 20th century in the
                                    north-eastern part of the village. In 1989, the famous French cinematographer Jean
                                    Kerchner appeared in Derechin. He wants to ennoble the graves of those close to his
                                    wife Irena Zhukovskaya, who was from Derechin. During World War II, 15-year-old
                                    Irena was taken to Germany. French troops freed her from captivity, she did not
                                    return to her homeland, but went to France, where she met Jean. After the death of
                                    his wife, Kerchner comes to Irena's native village and, noticing a dilapidated
                                    temple, decides to honor his wife's memory by restoring it at his own expense. The
                                    parishioners themselves take an active part in the charitable action. The
                                    reconstruction of the temple begins in 1991 and lasts a year. The church has a new
                                    roof, freshly painted vaults, a new marble floor. The temple is consecrated.</p>
