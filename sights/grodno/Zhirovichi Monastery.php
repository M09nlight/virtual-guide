                <h3>Zhirovichi Monastery</h3>
                <p class="text">This monastery was founded at the end of the 15th century. It is here that the icon of Our Lady of Zhirovichi is kept, which is revered as miraculous. An old legend is associated with it, which you will definitely be told during a visit to the monastery. However, it is popular not only among pilgrims seeking spiritual enlightenment.</p>

                <p class="text">This monastery is also a unique architectural complex - one of the few Belarusian Orthodox monasteries that could reach our time almost unchanged. Its buildings reflect different stages of the development of architecture (from baroque to late classicism and retrospective-Russian style).</p>
