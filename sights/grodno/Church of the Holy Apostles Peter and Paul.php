                    The temple stands on the site of an older Gothic church, the construction of which dates back to
                    1491-1495. In the second half of the 16th century, the church was converted into a Calvinist
                    cathedral, but soon Ivye passed into the possession of the magnate Jan Kiszka, who spread Arianism
                    in his possessions. The Arians founded a printing house and a school at the temple, whose rector in
                    1585-1593 was Jan Namyslovsky.
