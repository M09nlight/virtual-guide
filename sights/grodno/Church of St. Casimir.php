                <h3>Church of St. Casimir</h3>
                <p class="text">Kazimierz Church in Lipnishki was built of wood until 1510, which burned down during the war with Sweden. Until 1744, the church was rebuilt at the expense of the owner of the town, Count Galyan Bezborodka. The church had an organ for twenty voices. After the fire, the temple was restored. An expensive project of a church in a style not at all characteristic of the country was bought in 1890. The foundation stone of the architectural monument was laid on May 1, 1894, although construction began in 1900 and ended in 1910.</p>

                <p class="text">The building is rectangular in plan with a trihedral apse and a narthex, square in plan, above which rises an octahedral tower, completed with an elegant tent with lucarnes. On the sides of the main volume, small sacristias are symmetrically attached, which from the outside resemble the wings of a transept. The walls are faced with granite, reinforced with flat buttresses. Arched openings. The main entrance is punctuated by a figured portal. Inside the building of the church is divided by pillars into three naves. The vaults are cross, above the entrance there are choirs with an organ.</p>
