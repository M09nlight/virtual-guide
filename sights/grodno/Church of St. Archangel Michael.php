                <h3>Church of St. Archangel Michael</h3>
                <p class="text">A special place among the attractions of the Volkovysk region is the Church of St. Archangel Michael in Gniezno, which dates back to the beginning of the 16th century. This is a rare example of Gothic architecture in the Belarusian lands, which has survived to this day almost unchanged.</p>

                <p class="text">The appearance of the Gniezno church also contains features of Renaissance architecture, and the decorative details are similar to those that adorn the Mir Castle. This can hardly be called a coincidence: the founder of the temple was married to the niece of Yuri Ilyinich, under whom the construction of the Mir Castle began.</p>
