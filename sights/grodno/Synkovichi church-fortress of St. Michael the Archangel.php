                <h3>Synkovichi church-fortress of St. Michael the Archangel</h3>
                <p class="text">Covered with legends, the Synkovichi Church of the Holy Archangel Michael has been attracting human souls for six centuries. This temple is not without reason called the pearl of architecture: Gothic and traditions of Byzantine culture are combined here. Massive, half a meter thick walls, powerful faceted towers are elements of a fortress that once stood on an artificial island and was surrounded on all sides by water. The church, which was closed for many years, is now functioning. Moreover, it is one of the most visited temples in our republic. They go to the miraculous icon of the Mother of God, which, as they say, helps even cancer patients to recover. St. Michael's Church is full of mysteries and miracles. Even the date of its appearance still no one can name. According to some sources, it was built in the 15th century. However, during the restoration, evidence of an earlier history of this temple was discovered. Since it has four towers, some assumed that it was a mosque or a pagan temple. The description of the church contains information about the existence of graffiti dated 1347 and 1352, where the name of Prince Olgerd is mentioned.</p>
