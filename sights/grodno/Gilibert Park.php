                <h3>Gilibert Park</h3>
                <p class="text">The beautiful park-garden of the city above the Neman is named after the famous physician, botanist and biologist, educator of his time, Jean Emmanuel Gilibert. He was born in 1741 in French Lyon, lived and worked in his homeland, and then, at the invitation of the Grodno headman Anthony Tyzengauz, ended up in Grodno and did a lot for the city. Thanks to Gilibert, the first Medical Academy in the country and one of the best botanical gardens in Europe were created. His collection included more than 2,000 plant species. Today this place is called "Grodno Switzerland" for winding streams and hilly terrain.</p>
