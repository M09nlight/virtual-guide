                <h3>Trinity Church</h3>
                <p class="text">The Trinity Church in Ishchelno is considered a striking example of the late Baroque. The construction of this temple according to the project of the famous architect was completed in 1758. Inside the temple stands out the baroque altar, decorated with stucco and Corinthian columns. An ancient organ and many items used for worship have also been preserved.</p>

                <p class="text">Of particular interest are the sundial, which is located on a stone pedestal in the southern part of the churchyard. They were made in the 18th century by the Vilna craftsman Maletsky and showed the time very accurately due to the fact that the latitude at which they would be used was taken into account when creating the clock.</p>
