                <h3>Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary</h3>
                <p class="text">The Church of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary was built in 1646 by Kazimir Lev Sapieha, as evidenced by the inscription on the pediment above the frantal in Latin: "For the glory of Almighty God and in honor of the Ascension of the Most Pure, this temple was built by Casimir Lev Sapieha, sub-chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Slonim Derzhavtsa 1646 N. X.". Dyatlovsky church is noted for its high artistic qualities. It belongs to the original architectural monuments of the 1st half of the 17th century, which combine the features of the Renaissance, early Baroque with Gothic elements. The decoration of the temple resembles the stucco molding of the churches of Vilnius and Slonim and was made directly by the masters of the Vilna school. The temple is included in the State List of Historical and Cultural Values of the Republic of Belarus, located in the heart of the town, on its central square.</p>
