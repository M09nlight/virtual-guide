                <h3>Church of the Mother of God</h3>
                <p class="text">Already in the 1990s, the construction of the Church of the Mother of God began. As a result, a monumental red-brick church appeared, which harmoniously combines the features of neo-Gothic and modern architecture in its appearance.</p>
                <img src="../../images/grodno/62_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Red brick combined with laconic architecture creates a special aesthetic effect. The verticality of the temple is once again emphasized by high arched windows and a tower above the main entrance, decorated with a hipped roof. The ensemble is complemented by a low bell tower built in the same style.</p>
