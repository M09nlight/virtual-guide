                <h3>The most unusual house in Belarus.</h3>
                <p class="text">The brightest attraction of the Voronovsky district is the house-fortress in the village of Gaytyushniki. At the beginning of the 17th century, representatives of the Nonhart family built it as their residence. Thick walls, as well as towers located around the perimeter, were designed to inspire fear and respect.</p>

                <p class="text">The remains of ramparts and ditches indicate that it was a serious fortification. In fact, we are talking about a small castle, which even had its own garrison (it was located on the first floor). Today, this unique building houses a psychiatric hospital. It can only be viewed from the outside.</p>
