                <h3>Old and New castles</h3>
                <p class="text">In the city of princes and kings, there are two castles at once -Old and New. Centuries later, both buildings appear to tourists not in their original form, as they were repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt, but even today they are impressive. The castles are part of the museum complex, which tells about the surprisingly rich history of the city. Currently, the Old Castle is undergoing restoration, but the entrance is open to visitors. By the way, among its exhibits you can see the layout of the Gothic castle-fortress, as it was under the legendary Prince Vitovt.</p>
