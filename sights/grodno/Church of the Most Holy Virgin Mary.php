                <p class="text">The majestic, dignified Church of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, built in 1902-1909, rises in the center of the village.</p>

                <p class="text">Light, sloping lines of stepped buttresses outline the corners of its two neo-Gothic towers, between which there is a crenellated attic with whitewashed niches. This white and red motif is repeated in the design of the upper part of the portal. A chapel with a crenellated pediment and walls carefully lined with stone is built into the temple fence. The stone is effectively used in the cone-shaped chapel-tomb in the cemetery - it intrigues with its almost medieval "castle" appearance.</p>
