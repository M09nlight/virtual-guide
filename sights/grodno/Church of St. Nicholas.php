                <p class="text">Church of St. Nicholasin Bolshaya Berestovitsa was built in 1868 on the site where a wooden church used to be. The money needed for this was allocated from the treasury, part of the amount was donated by the parishioners and Count Kosakovsky. A century later, the building was turned into a warehouse, later repair shops were located here, only in 1989 it was returned to the Orthodox community.</p>
