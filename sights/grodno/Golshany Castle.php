                <h3>Golshany Castle</h3>
                <p class="text">Golshany Castle - a monument of palace and park architecture of the first half of the 17th century, the prototype of the castle from the famous work of the classic of Belarusian literature Vladimir Korotkevich "The Black Castle of Olshansky" Represented a stone three-story building with an entrance gate and a single-nave chapel. It was surrounded by earthen ramparts and bastions.</p>
                <img src="../../images/grodno/71_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The castle was built in the first half of the 17th century as the residence of the sub-chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Pavel Stefan Sapieha, the cousin of the author of the famous Statute of 1588, Leo Sapieha. Pavel Stefan left no heirs, and therefore, left without an owner, the castle began to pass from hand to hand.</p>
                <p class="text">The castle was poorly preserved (there were remains of walls and towers, as well as arched ceilings), moreover, researchers do not have sufficient information about how the castle looked in the 17th century. Therefore, the architects who are developing projects for the restoration of the Golshany Castle rightly believe that the complete reconstruction of the building is fraught with the loss of the uniqueness of the object. There is a proposal to cover the ruins with something like a dome made of glass and concrete, thus protecting the ruins from the negative effects of climatic conditions.</p>
