                <h3>Squirrel Museum</h3>
                <p class="text">In 2012, the district center acquired another iconic attraction: the former pre-revolutionary fire station houses the Squirrel Museum, one of the few in the world dedicated to this animal. The choice is explained by the fact that it is the red squirrel that is depicted on the coat of arms of the city.</p>

                <p class="text">Museum visitors can learn a lot of interesting things not only about her and her immediate family, but also about the nature of the region, its history and culture. In addition, a live squirrel lives in the enclosure right on the territory of the museum (it was born in captivity and is not afraid of people).</p>
