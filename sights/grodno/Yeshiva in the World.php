                <h3>Yeshiva in the World</h3>
                <p class="text">In Mir, the building of a yeshiva (an educational institution where rabbis were
                    trained), which was founded in 1815 and was famous far beyond the borders of Belarus, has been
                    preserved.
                    Other buildings of the former synagogue courtyard have survived, including the "warm" and "cold"
                    synagogues, heder.

                <p class="text">Together with the church of St. Nicholas, which was built only a few decades after the Mir Castle (work was completed in 1605), the Trinity Church in a retrospective Russian style and the old houses on the market square, they perfectly convey the spirit of the Belarusian town with its mixture of cultures and religions.</p>
