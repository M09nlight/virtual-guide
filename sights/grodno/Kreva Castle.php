                <h3>Kreva Castle</h3>
                <p class="text">The castle, located on the outskirts of Kreva, is considered one of the most important historical monuments not only by Belarusians, but also by Lithuanians. It was in his cellars, on the orders of Jagiello, that Keystut was strangled, and Vytautas barely escaped death by escaping in a woman's dress. Later, it was here that the Union of Krewo was signed, marking the strategic union of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and Poland.</p>

                <p class="text">This castle withstood more than one siege. However, time and the First World War turned it into picturesque ruins. It seems that Krevo Castle will not remain in this state for long: restoration work has begun. There is an opportunity to watch their progress and touch this page of our common history.</p>
