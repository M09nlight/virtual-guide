                <h3>Manor Oginsky</h3>
                <p class="text">Not far from the village of Zalesye is the estate of the Oginsky family, who owned these lands since the 18th century. For a long time the main buildings remained wooden. The manor in its present form appeared at the beginning of the 19th century, when Michal Kleofas Oginsky, a prominent participant in the Kosciuszko uprising and the author of the famous polonaise Farewell to the Motherland, returned from forced emigration.</p>

                <p class="text">Today, the estate houses a museum. In its halls, the gentry life of that distant era was carefully recreated.</p>
