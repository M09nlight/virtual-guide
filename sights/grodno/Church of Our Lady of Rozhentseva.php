                <h3>Church of Our Lady of Rozhentseva</h3>
                <p class="text">The Church of Our Lady of the Rozhentsova in Soly belongs to the neo-Baroque style. However, the architect's fantasy seriously pushed his boundaries. No wonder the church in Soly, because of its asymmetric composition and unusual architectural forms, which seem to be borrowed from nature itself, is compared with the creations of the famous Antonio Gaudi.</p>

                <p class="text">However, the church in Soly is interesting not only for its appearance. Inside, there are frescoes created in the 1930s, when this village was still part of Poland. Instead of biblical scenes, they show events related to the siege of the Jasnogorsk monastery in CzÄ™stochowa by the Swedish troops, as well as the events of the Soviet-Polish war, known as the Miracle over the Vistula.</p>
