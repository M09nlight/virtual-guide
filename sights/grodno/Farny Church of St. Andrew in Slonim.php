                <h3>Farny Church of St. Andrew in Slonim</h3>
                <p class="text">Slonim is rightfully proud of its Catholic shrines. Farny Church of St. Apostle Andrew was built in 1775. It is considered a true masterpiece of the late Baroque. Impressive is not only the magnificent facade with two high towers, but also the richly decorated interior, which includes paintings, stucco and a carved altar in the classicist style.</p>

                <p class="text">A whole century older than another Catholic church - the Church of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Holy Virgin Mary, which was once part of the Bernardine convent. The residential building, which was erected in the second half of the 18th century, has also survived to this day (for a long time the buildings of this monastery were wooden).</p>
