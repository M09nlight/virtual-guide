                <h3>Plane-monument to P. Sukhoi</h3>
                <p class="text">A symbolic monument to one of the founders of Soviet supersonic and jet aviation was
                    erected on a pedestal near the road. Su-17M tail number 101, a formidable aircraft nicknamed
                    "drying", is preparing to take off right at the entrance to the city. This is the first Soviet
                    aircraft with a variable sweep wing. Such an unusual monument was erected here in memory of the
                    famous native of Glubokoye, Pavel Sukhoi.</p>

                <p class="text">Twice Hero of the Soviet Union, the aircraft designer is the author of more than fifty
                    aircraft models, including the Su-2 bomber. Pavel Sukhoi lived in the Vitebsk region for the first
                    five years of his life, but he always spoke warmly of his small homeland. In Glubokoe they are also
                    proud of their talented compatriot. Three models of his aircraft can be found in the city. The first
                    one is at the entrance to the city, the second SU-27 is located in Victory Park, and the third plane
                    can be seen near Lake Kagalnoe, next to school No. 1, which is also named after Sukhoi.
