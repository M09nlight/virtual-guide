                <h3>MONUMENT TSMOKU</h3>
                <p class="text">On the shores of Lake Lepel in the city park in September 2013, a real dragon settled.
                    True, bronze, single-headed and very kind. According to local residents, it does not fly, fire does
                    not exhale and does not offend anyone.</p>
                <p class="text">The sculpture of a mythical snake-like creature appeared here thanks to the initiative
                    of a local historian, Vladimir Shushkevich, who decided in this way to perpetuate the brand of the
                    region - Tsmok Lepelsky, a character from the mythology of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/51_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">It was Lepel that was considered the birthplace of Tsmok thanks to Vladimir
                    Korotkevich’s historical novel “Christ Jumping in Gardens (Evangelelle ad Judas)”, which describes
                    in detail the appearance of the monster and tells how in the Middle Ages about 40 Tsmok died in Lake
                    Lepel in one night. It is the casting of this book that is located today at the feet of Lepelsky
                    Tsmok.</p>
