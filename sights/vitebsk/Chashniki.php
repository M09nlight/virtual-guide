                <h3>Chashniki</h3>
                <p class="text">The small town of Chashniki is located 90 kilometers west of the regional center of
                    Vitebsk. Chashniki attract the attention of connoisseurs of recreation in Belarus due to their
                    unique nature, rich history and centuries-old legends.</p>

                <p class="text">The first mention in documents about the city on the river Ulle dates back to 1504.
                    Being in the possession of many magnates during its long history, Chashniki managed to retain the
                    status of one of the main shopping centers in northern Belarus. And at different times the princes
                    Lukomsky, the magnates Kishki, Sapieha and Volotkevichi owned the town. The real impetus to the
                    rapid growth of Chashnik was given by the construction of a pier on the river, from the workshops of
                    which many merchant ships left. The city was not bypassed by the wars that dashed through the
                    country. Grand Duke of Lithuania Stefan Batory and Russian prince Menshikov stopped in Chashniki
                    during campaigns, and during the war of 1812, a fierce battle broke out near the city between French
                    and Russian troops.
