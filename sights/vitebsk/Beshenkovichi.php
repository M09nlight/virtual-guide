                <h3>Beshenkovichi</h3>
                <p class="text">Today Beshenkovichi is an urban settlement located in the north of Belarus and is part of the Vitebsk region. The distance from it to the regional center barely exceeds 50 kilometers.</p>
                <p class="text">The first written evidence of the existence of the Beshenkovichi dates back to 1447.</p>
                <p class="text">An important event in the history of the village was its acquisition in 1630 by Pavel Sapega, who not only transformed the village into a township, but also contributed to the acquisition of Magdeburg rights.</p>

                <p class="text">At the same time, a pier appeared on the banks of the Western Dvina, thanks to which the Beshenkovichi began to trade with Riga. And in the village itself annually (twice a year) fairs began to be held, gathering several thousand people.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Beshenkovichi did not bypass the Northern War either. So, at the beginning of the 18th century, Peter I visited the village three times. Here, in his honor, the Peter and Paul Church was built. Unfortunately, the temple has not survived to this day.</p>
