        <img src="../../images/vitebsk/1_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
        <p class="text">Vitebsk is the Mecca of Belarusian artists, the birthplace of Marc Chagall
          and Ossip Zadkine. This is a city of three rivers and five landscape tiers, where tourists rush for a spirit
          of the empty old brick-styled streets and a couple of clubs with inexpensive concerts. Latvians, Poles,
          Belarusians, Jews and Russians were adding spices to the salad bowl of this city for a thousand of years.
          The city defended the eastern borders of the Polotsk Duchy, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Polish-Lithuanian
          Commonwealth. During the Russian Empire times there studied the first female doctor of philosophy, and also
          the world's first parachute jump by Mrs. Drevnickaja happened here.
          The citizens were greatly depopulated
          during the second World War and the Stalinist purges. In its new revival in the early twentieth century, the
          city raised the flag with the profiles of Chagall and Malevich on it, and started sculpting the new brand:
          Vitebsk is the city of painters.
