                <p class="text">On the site of the current church of St. Anthony, there was once a wooden one, but in
                    1812 it was burned by the French. Soon the construction of a new stone temple in the eclectic style
                    began. The tsarist government allocated 2,000 silver rubles and allowed the former customs buildings
                    to be disassembled into bricks, and the landowner Slavinsky donated one hundred thousand bricks. But
                    the collected funds were not enough to complete the construction, and the work was suspended. The
                    temple was opened only in 1853. It was closed in the 1930s. During the Second World War, captured
                    Red Army soldiers were kept in its cellars. After the war, the building housed a weaving workshop, a
                    furniture store, a weight workshop, and a granary. Later, it was partially renovated to open a cafe
                    and a club here. In 1993 the church was returned to believers. This is the only active Catholic
                    church in the three surrounding areas.</p>
