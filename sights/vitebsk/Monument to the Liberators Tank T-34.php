                <p class="text">During the Great Patriotic War, Liozno was liberated from the Nazi invaders on October
                    8, 1943. Vitebsk, located 40 kilometers from the city, was liberated only on June 24, 1944. The long
                    9 months of bloody battles for the Liozno region were paid at a high price.</p>

                <p class="text">At the entrance to Liozno on the Vitebsk-Smolensk highway, in memory of the fallen
                    soldiers, a monument to the liberators was erected - a T-34 tank on a concrete pedestal.</p>

                    the dead. The whole world is collecting money for the new monument. Search engines collect bit by
