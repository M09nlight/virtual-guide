                <h3>The Chashnik Historical Museum</h3>
                <p class="text">The Chashnik Historical Museum was opened to visitors in 1991. The local merchant
                    Gurevich once lived in the museum building.</p>
                <p class="text">The exposition of the museum tells about the historical perspective of the city and is
                    represented by more than 7,000 exhibits.</p>
                <p class="text">6 exhibition halls offer visitors to get acquainted with the history of the region. Rare
                    archaeological finds are exhibited here: glass bracelets of the 12th century, a jewelry ring from
                    the 16th century, a hand-painted travel chest and much more.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/39_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Of particular interest will be the collection of ceremonial handbrake. Each of them is
                    individual and not similar to the previous one. Fabric bedding, a handmade gilded cross and a holy
                    crucifix. All this will tell about the crafts and craftsmen of the Chashniksky district.
                </p>
                <p class="text">It is impossible to pass by rare icons. The collection of iconography is not numerous,
                    but it reflects the deep religious meaning of the life of local residents.</p>
                <p class="text">The crafts of the region are represented by cast patterns, ceramics, and musical
                    instruments. The museum has a huge book collection, some of which are presented to visitors. Museum
                    employees are still carrying out research work, replenishing the exhibition halls with new exhibits.
