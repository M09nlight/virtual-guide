                <h3>Church of the Holy Trinity</h3>
                <p class="text">The Trinity Church is a cultural and historical monument of architecture, which belongs
                    to the Vilna Baroque style. A clear silhouette of the church is formed by two towers and a high
                    gable above the apse. In the process of rebuilding the church, both towers increased in size by two
                    tiers.</p>

                <p class="text">Inside the temple there are three carved wooden altars in a typical baroque style. The
                    first tier of the central altar is presented in the form of a colonnade with statues of two apostles
                    Paul and Peter. The second tier is a rectangular shield, on which is placed the icon of the Mother
                    of God Hodegetria from the beginning of the 18th century. The altar is completed by a beautiful
                    composition called "Gloria with Angels". This is an impressive three-tiered work of art, which is
                    admired by every visitor to the Trinity Church who has ever visited it. The temple also houses a
                    portable altar with three icons from the beginning of the 18th century - "Joseph with a Child",
                    "Holy Family" and "Mother of God Tenderness". Right above the entrance to the church there are
                    choirs with a large organ, made in the Neo-Gothic style.

                <p class="text">The interior in terms of decoration is clearly designed in the characteristic Vilna
                    style. The main facade is decorated with a large number of decorative elements: unusual layered
                    pilasters with an exquisite pattern, a cornice with a broken line, carved arches of the openings, as
                    well as a pediment with the image of the “Crucifixion” in the arch opening are presented here.</p>
