                <h3>Church of the Icon of the Mother of God</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of the Icon of the Mother of God is a historical building of the late 19th century in Sharkovshchina, an architectural monument (number 213Ð“000828). Located in the center of the village, on Engels street.</p>
                <p class="text">The church was built in 1898 on the site of an old wooden church (built in 1841). The original appearance of the church was preserved thanks to a photograph by J. Balzunkevich (between 1910-1914). It suffered during the Great Patriotic War. After restoration in 1948, it was converted into a club, later there was a shop in the church. In 1990, the building was returned to believers and was restored.</p>

                <p class="text">The brick church is decorated in the Russian style. The composition of the church consists of four parts: a belfry, in which there are two tiers (an octagon on a quadrangle), crowned with a tent; vestibule; the main volume of the prayer hall in the shape of a cube, ending with a four-pitched roof with a small onion dome on an octagonal drum; semicircular apse. Among the design elements are keel-like arches characteristic of ancient Russian architecture, an arcade belt, and rusticated shoulder blades at the corners. Architectural elements are highlighted with a contrasting color - red on a white background. The entrance to the church is decorated with an arched portal.</p>
