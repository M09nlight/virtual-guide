                <h3>Gorodok</h3>
                <p class="text">Gorodok is a regional center in the north of the Vitebsk region. Located 30 kilometers
                    from Vitebsk.</p>
                <p class="text">he first chronicle mention of Gorodok dates back to the 13th century. In the description
                    of the battle of the Polotsk and Lithuanians, a small “Town near Polotsk” is mentioned. The exact
                    mention of the name dates back to 1551.</p>
                <p class="text">By the middle of the 16th century, the settlement had grown; a bastion castle with
                    defensive ramparts was built here. The town quickly became the center of a military parish. The
                    castle was attacked several times by enemies and was eventually destroyed. But its ruins can still
                    be seen in Gorodok. Archaeological excavations were carried out on them, the found objects are
                    placed in the local museum of local lore.</p>

                <p class="text">After the first partition of the Commonwealth, Gorodok became part of the Russian
                    Empire. At the beginning of the 20th century, a railway line passed through it, which contributed to
                    additional economic growth. There were 14 factories, a factory, more than 200 trade and craft
                    establishments in the industrial city. There were 10 synagogues, 2 churches, a hospital and three
                    pharmacies were built. Fairs were held here three times a year.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1918, Gorodok became part of the BNR, but a year later it was given to the BSSR.
                    During the Second World War, the city was badly damaged and was liberated in December 1943. In honor
                    of the liberators, a memorial sign was erected on the central square.</p>
