                <h3>Monument to the letter "Ў"</h3>
                <p class="text">The monument to the unusual letter "ў" is located in Polotsk, the most ancient city in
                    Belarus. The monument is unique and original, it has no analogues anywhere. The explanation for this
                    is very simple, because the letter "ў" exists in only one language among all existing ones - in
                    Belarusian. This letter is called “u unsyllabic”, translated into Russian “u non-syllabic”. "Ў" is
                    often called a unique symbol of the Belarusian language.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Although the Polotsk monument is dedicated to only one letter, it essentially reflects
                    the originality and exclusivity of the entire Belarusian language, and at the same time the
                    Belarusian people.</p>
                <p class="text">The letter "Ў" was immortalized in granite in 2003 on September 3rd. It is on this day
                    that the holiday "Day of Belarusian Writing" is celebrated. The author of the composition is Igor
                    Kurzhalov, the chief artist of the city of Polotsk. The monument itself was cast at one of the local
                    enterprises.</p>
                <p class="text">As you know, only Belarusians speak the Belarusian language, and even then the country
                    has two official languages, including Russian. It is very important that Belarusians do not lose
                    their language along with their national pride. The monument to the letter "Ў" is another evidence
                    of the originality and originality of the Belarusian language and the Belarusian people.</p>
