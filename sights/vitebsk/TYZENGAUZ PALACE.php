                <h3>TYZENGAUZ PALACE</h3>
                <p class="text">The palace complex in the style of classicism was built in Postavy in the second half of the 18th century for Anthony Tyzengauz according to the design of the Italian architect Giuseppe di Sacco.</p>

                <p class="text">Later it was rebuilt several times by the following owners. Next to the palace, a regular-landscape park was laid out, covering an area of about 10 hectares, of which only fragments now remain. After the Second World War, the interior of the palace was heavily rebuilt for the needs of a medical institution. The building still houses the Postavy Central District Hospital.</p>
                <p class="text">In 2006, a monument was erected in front of the palace to Konstantin Tyzengauz, a famous ornithologist who developed a system for classifying birds, which is also used by modern scientists. He was also the author of several illustrated books on ornithology and the creator of the ornithological museum in the palace. In 2014, the basement of the palace was renovated, and a museum exposition was created in them, telling about the activities of Tyzengauz.</p>
