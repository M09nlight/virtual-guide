                <p class="text">Glubokoe is a city in the Vitebsk region of Belarus, the administrative center of the
                    Glubokoe district. The main attractions of the city of Glubokoe are two temples that form a very
                    remarkable architectural ensemble - the Church of the Holy Trinity and the Cathedral of the Nativity
                    of the Blessed Virgin, located nearby in the historical center of the city and outwardly very
                    similar to each other. One of these temples, the Trinity Church, was built in the town of Glubokoe
                    in 1782 and substantially rebuilt in 1908. It should be noted that the reconstruction of the
                    beginning of the 20th century did not touch the main facade of the church, which has been preserved
                    since the 18th century. This church in the city of Glubokoe is quite large, beautiful and memorable
                    appearance and fits perfectly into the surrounding landscape. The Church of the Holy Trinity in the
                    town of Glubokoe is well preserved and is an important architectural monument of the 18th century.
