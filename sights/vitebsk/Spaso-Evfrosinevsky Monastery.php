                <h3>Spaso-Evfrosinevsky Monastery</h3>
                <p class="text">Polotsk is one of the oldest cities in Kievan Rus. The history of this principality is
                    closely connected with the name of Efrosinya of Polotsk, a princess canonized by the Orthodox
                    Church. It was under her and through her efforts that the monastery was founded in 1125, today
                    called Spaso-Efrosinievskiy. It is not surprising that today it is one of the holy places of White
                    Rus' and the most ancient monastery here.
                    Due to its location (the lands of the former Principality of Polotsk were the subject of territorial
                    claims of the Moscow State, the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, and later the Commonwealth), the monastery
                    several times passed to the Jesuits, then again became Orthodox. In 1820, when Polotsk was part of
                    the Russian Empire, the Jesuits were expelled from its borders. One of the greatest shrines returned
                    to the monastery - the Cross of Euphrosyne of Polotsk, created in the 12th century by the master
                    jeweler Lazar Bogsha, with particles of the relics of saints and the Life-Giving Cross of the Lord.

                <p class="text">The oldest temple of the monastery is the Cathedral of the Transfiguration of the
                    Savior, built by St. Euphrosyne in 1161. The church is a unique example of a special architectural
                    style, the style of the Principality of Polotsk. Interestingly, its walls have survived to this day
                    almost intact from the 12th century! Inside there are marvelous frescoes of the same century.</p>
                <p class="text">Other temples of the monastery are not so ancient, but no less beautiful. In particular,
                    the Exaltation of the Cross Cathedral, built in 1897 in the pseudo-Byzantine style, designed by the
                    architect Korshikov, or the warm Efrosinevsky Church. The main shrine of the monastery is the relics
                    of St. Euphrosyne, as well as the restored Cross - its original, created in the 12th century,
                    disappeared in 1941 and has not yet been found.</p>
                <p class="text">The local bell tower is also noteworthy, for which in 2001 three new bells were cast in
                    Minsk, and in 2002 a festive evangelist weighing more than 3 tons joined them. In addition, there
                    are sister buildings on the territory of the monastery, where more than 70 nuns live today.</p>
