                <p class="text">The mountain offers a beautiful view of the city and nearby lakes. Remains of the rampart surrounding the settlement have been preserved. Castle Hill was explored by archaeologists in the 1950s and 1980s. It has a sign in honor of the founding of Braslav - a granite boulder, on which a commemorative bronze plaque is attached.</p>
                <p class="text">On Castle Hill is the grave of Dr. Stanislav Narbut (1853â€“1926), who worked as a doctor in Braslav for over 40 years and was highly respected by the townspeople. The grave is decorated with a high white obelisk mounted on a massive pedestal with a lantern on top.</p>
