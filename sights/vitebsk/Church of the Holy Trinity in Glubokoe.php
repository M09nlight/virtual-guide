                <h3>Church of the Holy Trinity in Glubokoe</h3>
                <p class="text">Catholic church in the town of Glubokoe (Vitebsk region). A monument of architecture in the Baroque style, built in 1764-1782, rebuilt in 1902-1908.</p>
                <p class="text">The Catholic parish of the Holy Trinity in Glubokoe was founded by the voivode of Mstislav JÃ³zef Korsak in 1628, who also built a Catholic church in the early baroque style. From 1764 to 1782, a new building of the Church of the Holy Trinity in the late Baroque style was erected on the site of the old one.</p>

                <p class="text">In 1878, the Russian authorities closed the Carmelite monastery in Glubokoye, and the Carmelite church, another Catholic church in Glubokoye, was turned into the Orthodox Church of the Nativity of the Virgin, in which capacity it is still used today. The Trinity Church remained the only Catholic church in Glubokoye, but since it could hardly accommodate all the parishioners, there was a need to expand it.</p>
                <p class="text">The reconstruction of the temple took place in 1902-1908 according to the project of engineer-architect Anthony Dubovik. The restructuring left the main facade of the 18th century intact, the rest of the temple was built in a pseudo-baroque style, imitating the Vilna baroque.</p>
