                <h3>Boris stone</h3>
                <p class="text">There are several unique monuments in Belarus called Boris stones. These are hefty
                    boulders with embossed inscriptions and crosses. Most often, the text “God help your servant, Boris
                    the son of Ginvilov” is carved on the stone. The stones are named after Polotsk Prince Boris, who
                    ruled in the 12th century. There are only 4 of them left in the country. One of them is in Polotsk.

                <p class="text">How these stones appeared, for what reason, is still unknown. Some experts believe that
                    trade routes were marked in this way in ancient times. Others are sure that these were the sacred
                    stones of the pagans, and the cross was knocked out after the adoption of Orthodoxy.</p>
