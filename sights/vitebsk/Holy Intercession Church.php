                <h3>Holy Intercession Church</h3>
                <p class="text">The Holy Intercession Church is made in a retrospective Russian style, the modern
                    building was built in 1900-1903, and at the same time the Orthodox church was lit in honor of the
                    Intercession of the Virgin.</p>
                <p class="text">The first temple in Dokshitsy is mentioned in the chronicle at the beginning of the 16th
                    century, when the masters of wooden architecture erected the first Orthodox church in the village.
                    Only 350 years later it was decided to build a new stone church, and during its construction to
                    reconstruct the old one for parishioners.</p>

                <p class="text">The wartime for the Church of the Intercession was not easy: the city was captured by
                    the Germans, and the church building was used as barracks for prisoners of war. But even at this
                    time services were held here on holidays.</p>
                <p class="text">Since 2012, the temple has opened its doors to believers not only on weekends, but also
                    on weekdays. Often the services are conducted by the rector of the church himself, and local
                    residents and visiting tourists can put candles, order a prayer service and pray.</p>
