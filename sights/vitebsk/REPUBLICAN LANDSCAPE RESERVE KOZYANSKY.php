                <h3>REPUBLICAN LANDSCAPE RESERVE "KOZYANSKY"</h3>
                <p class="text">Republican landscape reserve "Kozyansky" was established in 1999. Today it is a whole
                    swamp-forest complex, whose total area is more than 26,000 hectares. Due to its difficult terrain,
                    this specially protected natural area serves as a safe haven for a number of rare and endangered
                    species.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/54_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Among them, first of all, it is necessary to single out the lynx and the brown bear,
                    which are very sensitive to the presence of a person. The fact that they are found on the territory
                    of the reserve throughout the year, once again emphasizes its uniqueness. In total, 68 species of
                    plants and animals listed in the Red Book of Belarus were identified here.
                </p>
                <p class="text">Due to the fact that most of the territory of the Kozyansky reserve is practically
                    unaffected by human activity, it can serve as a kind of standard of natural complexes characteristic
                    of the Belarusian Lakeland. The age-old oak alley, located on the northeastern outskirts of the
                    village of Prudok, also deserves attention (it has been declared a natural monument of local
                    importance).</p>
