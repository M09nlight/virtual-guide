                <p class="text">The side facades are divided by five arches. On the red background of the walls, the
                    white details of the architectural decor stand out in contrast. The temple remained active until
                    1936. During the war, it was reopened, and it operated until 1961. The temple was partially
                    destroyed at the end of May 1959 and rebuilt as a warehouse. In 1989 the temple building was
                    returned to believers and restored. On January 26, 2001 the parish was registered. Near the temple
                    is a holy spring, known since the 17th century, helping those suffering from eye diseases.
