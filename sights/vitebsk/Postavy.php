                <h3>Postavy</h3>
                <p class="text">Postavy traces its history back to the beginning of the 15th century, although in fact
                    this settlement is probably much older, just no evidence of its more distant past has been
                    preserved. For a long time, Postavy remained only one of the numerous Belarusian towns, until under
                    the Tyzenhauz they turned into a real economic and scientific center.</p>
