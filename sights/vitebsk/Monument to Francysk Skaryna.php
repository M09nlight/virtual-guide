                <h3>Monument to Francysk Skaryna</h3>
                <p class="text">Francysk Skaryna is one of the "universal geniuses" of the Renaissance. A contemporary
                    of Raphael and Leonardo da Vinci, he was a philosopher, scientist, inventor and physician. A native
                    of Polotsk was not attracted to the family trading business, he passionately desired knowledge.
                    After leaving his home, Francis studied at the universities of Krakow and Padua, received the degree
                    of doctor of medicine and "free sciences".

                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/28_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">With all the vicissitudes of life, he never forgot his native city and called it
                    "glorious Polotsk" in his letters. Polochans erected a monument to their great countryman in 1974.
                    Its authors are sculptors A. Glebov, I. Glebov and A. Zaspitsky. The bronze monument 5.5 m high
                    stands on a 7-meter pedestal. The muscular hand of the worker lies on his book. Maybe it's "Apostle"
                    or "Small travel book", which served as a faithful companion to many Slavic merchants and artisans.
                    The printer's thoughts are already in the next work. The scientist's gaze is directed into the
                    distance, as if he sees there, in the fog of time, all the difficulties that await his people on the
                    path to knowledge and freedom.</p>
