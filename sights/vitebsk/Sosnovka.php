                <p class="text">You can cycle to Sosnovka to enjoy poplar alleys, forests and endless fields. On the way to the main lake in the village itself, you can drive through the forest to see an almost perfectly round wild lake called "Devil's".  It will not be easy to get to it - the road lies through the swampy area. Look for the exact location of the lake on the map.

                <p class="text">Then leave the forest - and head straight to the big lake. You can get to it immediately and by train from Vitebsk. On the lake, a local resident once installed bridges that still serve people as a place for fishing and recreation. Do not forget to take a blanket to sit on the bridge and watch the life of lake ducks. In the summer, by the way, you can swim here.</p>
