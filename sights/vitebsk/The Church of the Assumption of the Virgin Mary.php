                <h3>The Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary</h3>
                <p class="text">The main and in fact the only attraction of the city of Miory is the Church of the
                    Assumption of the Virgin Mary. This church was built in the city of Miory in 1907. In 1951, the
                    temple was adapted for a grain warehouse, but already in 1956 the church in the city of Miory was
                    returned to believers. In 1957, after restoration, the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary
                    was re-consecrated and has been continuously functioning since then. In Soviet times, literally a
                    few churches remained operating on the territory of Belarus, which makes the history of each of
                    these churches very unusual in its own way.</p>

                <p class="text">The temple in the city of Miory has a very impressive size. It is very well located on
                    the shore of a large lake, thanks to which the church in the city of Miory offers a beautiful view
                    from many points in the city and its environs. On the territory near the church there are several
                    interesting monuments. One of these monuments is dedicated to the unborn child. This monument
                    depicts a guillotine that hangs over the embryo in the womb. The monument to the unborn child in the
                    city of Miory makes a strong impression. The church in the city of Miory is an architectural
                    monument of the early 20th century, a historical and cultural value and an important landmark of
                    Belarus. The picturesqueness of the city of Miory is due to its location on the shore of the already
                    mentioned large lake, which is called Lake Miory.</p>
