                <h3>CHURCH OF ST. CASIMIR</h3>
                <p class="text">This temple was built for almost 20 years: from 1857 to 1876, funds for it were donated by the landowner of the Lepel district, collegiate assessor Malchevsky.</p>
                <p class="text">The Church of St. Casimir was built in the classical style. Its main facade is decorated with two towers and a triangular pediment, the same triangular pediments are on the other facades of the building.</p>

                <p class="text">In 1935 the church was closed and the priest was arrested. The building was initially abandoned. In the 1970s-1980s, it had a garage and a transformer substation. Regular services have been held in the church since 1993, and in 1995 it was re-consecrated.</p>
                <p class="text">Opposite the church, in 2010, a monument was erected to the Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the former owner of Lepel, Lev Sapieha.</p>
