                <h3>MEMORIAL COMPLEX "PRORIV"</h3>
                <p class="text">The memorial complex is located seven kilometers west of the urban village of Ushachi,
                    between the villages of Paperino, Dvor-Plino and Novoye Selo.</p>
                <p class="text">Ushachi was occupied by the Nazi invaders in early July 1941. In September 1943, the
                    Ushach partisan zone was created, where there were 16 brigades numbering more than 17 thousand
                    people. In the spring of 1944, more than 60 thousand punishers were drawn to its borders. On April
                    11, the most significant punitive operation in the history of the Great Patriotic War began. For 25
                    days the partisans fought hard, but at the end of April Ushachi was abandoned by them. Previously,
                    the 230-kilometer defense was reduced to 20 kilometers. On May 4, the punishers blocked the people's
                    avengers in a small area of the Matyrin forest. On the night of May 5, the encircled detachments
                    broke through the blockade.</p>

                <p class="text">At the place where partisan detachments led by the future Hero of the Soviet Union V.E.
                    Lobank managed to break through the blockade and fight with punitive detachments before the approach
                    of the Red Army, in 1974 a memorial complex was created. At the beginning of the road that leads to
                    the memorial, a bronze slab was installed on a reinforced concrete podium with the following words:
                    â€œThere were 17,185 against 60,000. The courage of the people won. Death has become immortality.</p>
