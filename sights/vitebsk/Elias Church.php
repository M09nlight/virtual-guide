                <h3>Elias Church</h3>
                <p class="text">Perhaps the temple was erected in Beshenkovichi in 1447. It was one of six churches
                    built by order of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Casimir IV Jagiellonchik in honor of the prophet
                    Elijah - on the day of this saint, July 20, his wife Elizabeth was saved from drowning. The prince
                    ordered the construction of six Orthodox churches on the banks of the Western Dvina, Dnieper and
                    Sozh in Vitebsk, Beshenkovichi, Mogilev, Cherikov, Krichev and Orsha.</p>

                <p class="text">In 1866-1870, a stone shrine was erected on the site of the old temple. During the war,
                    the church was used as a warehouse, and a machine-gun nest was built on the bell tower. In military
                    photographs, the church is depicted with a destroyed bell tower. Now the temple has been restored,
                    operates and is open to the public.</p>
