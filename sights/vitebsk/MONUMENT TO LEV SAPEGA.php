                <p class="text">The idea to perpetuate the memory of this political figure, who played an important role
                    in the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, in Lepel is due to the fact that under him the main
                    city buildings were moved to a new place, which became an important stage in the life of the city
                    and determined its further successful development.</p>
