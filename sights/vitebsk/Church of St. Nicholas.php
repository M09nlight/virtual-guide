                <h3>Church of St. Nicholas</h3>
                <p class="text">The temple in honor of St. Nicholas was built in 1819 in the then popular style of classicism. This conveys the severity and conciseness of forms, the simplicity of the exterior decoration of the building, the symmetry and proportionality of the entire architectural ensemble. Quite recently, 15 years ago, a large bell weighing 7 pounds, cast in honor of the anniversary of the founding of the temple, appeared in the bell tower of the St. Nicholas Church.</p>
                <p class="text">The church is located in a very picturesque place, near the intersection of two rivers: Zap. Dvina and Drisa. At the end of the 19th century, it became the main cathedral church of the city and a favorite place for parishioners of the Orthodox denomination. Inside the temple there is a beautiful majestic carved iconostasis with the main shrine - the Ostrobrama Icon of the Mother of God.</p>

                <p class="text">Historical events did not greatly damage the external and internal decoration of the church. It remained active during the Second World War, but during its existence it was closed several times, the last - after the end of the war. The events of the October Revolution affected the activities of the church with an unpleasant incident: utensils and some decorations from inside the temple were taken away.</p>
