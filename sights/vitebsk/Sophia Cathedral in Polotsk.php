                <h3>Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk</h3>
                <p class="text">Sophia Cathedral in Polotsk is one of the most ancient Christian shrines located in
                    Belarus. In the 11th century, it became the fourth temple of Hagia Sophia in the world.

                <p class="text">Initially, the temple served as a fortress and was the embodiment of a powerful
                    statehood. Here they received ambassadors, decided the fate of different countries and protected
                    religious shrines. In the 18th century, the temple was deliberately blown up, and a new one, even
                    more majestic, was built in its place.</p>
                <p class="text">Sophia Cathedral is a unique monument of architecture and architecture. It even
                    preserved the remains of frescoes from the 11th century. The southern facade of the building strikes
                    with its unusual structure - its towers are located in such a way that they create a strong optical
                    perspective. From the side, it is clearly noticeable that the pediment has a lacy outline, like a
                    diadem crown.</p>
                <p class="text">The name of the author of the new cathedral is unknown, but his architectural style
                    remained - the style of the Vilna Baroque. This style can also be seen in the interior of the
                    cathedral. Particularly stands out is the stone altar partition, which resembles the altars of
                    Catholic churches.</p>
