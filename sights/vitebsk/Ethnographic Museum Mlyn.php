                <h3>Ethnographic Museum Mlyn</h3>

                <p class="text">The ethnographic complex is located near the railway station. This is a small open air
                    museum. Wooden, museum-like buildings of the late 19th-early 20th centuries represent the daily life
                    of the shtetl and have original interiors. The complex includes four objects: a mill (mlyn), a house
                    of vozvozniks, a sviran and a smithy.</p>

                <p class="text">The steam mill in Zaslavl was built in 1910. The mill served the inhabitants of Zaslavl
                    and its environs for many decades. In 1989, it was removed from the Zaslavsky district industrial
                    complex and transferred to the historical and cultural reserve, which museumified this object and
                    opened it to the public in 1990. In 1990-1996. the mechanisms of the mill were started by an
                    electric motor to demonstrate their work to visitors. The engine was then shut down and sealed for
                    fire safety reasons.</p>

                <p class="text">The house of vozvoznikov is a kind of hotel built by a miller for those people who
                    brought grain for grinding, providing them with "both table and shelter." Like a hundred years ago,
                    the hut still receives guests.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/11_3.png" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Sviran, standing behind the mill building, has a foundation made of field stones. Its
                    facade is a gallery with a balcony, the railings of which are decorated with carvings. Inside, along
                    the walls, there are bins for grain. In the center there are various containers woven from straw and
                    vines, as well as made from oak staves, under the stairs there is a kufar - a chest in which the
                    brides kept the dowry.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/11_4.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Not a single village and not a single place could do without a blacksmith before: there
                    was a great demand for metal products used in various spheres of life, including transport,
                    construction, and agriculture. A forge built in the first third of the 20th century will help a
                    modern tourist to immerse himself in the world of this difficult, but very necessary craft for
                    people.</p>
