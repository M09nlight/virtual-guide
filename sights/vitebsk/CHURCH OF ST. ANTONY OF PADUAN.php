                <h3>CHURCH OF ST. ANTONY OF PADUAN</h3>
                <p class="text">The Church of St. Anthony of Padua is a monument of neo-Gothic architecture. It was
                    erected from red unplastered brick in 1898-1904 according to the project of architect Arthur Goibel.

                <p class="text">The church has a plan in the form of a cross. The building of the church was badly
                    damaged during the First World War, but then restored in the 1920s. After Postavy became part of the
                    BSSR in 1939, the last rector of the temple, Boleslav Matseevsky, was arrested and died in Stalin's
                    camps. The church was closed and after the Second World War a warehouse was set up in it, later - a
                    workshop of an industrial enterprise. The shrine was returned to the Catholics only in 1988. After a
                    long restoration, the temple was opened for worship.</p>
