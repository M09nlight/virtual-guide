                <h3>Liozno</h3>

                <p class="text">Liozno is an urban village of the Vitebsk region, a green corner of Belarus with its
                    difficult and beautiful history.</p>

                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/15_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">For the first time in the chronicles Liozno was mentioned as a town already in the
                    middle of the 16th century. There is a version that in 1525 the son of a wealthy landowner
                    Mikulinsky married, and a land plot in the area of modern Liozno was donated to the young for the
                    construction of the estate. Over time, the estate grew into a whole village.</p>
                <p class="text">According to another version, the Liozno estate was founded by Bogdan Oginsky. The
                    emblem of the village with the family sign of the princes Oginsky speaks in her favor, who for a
                    long time - until 1770 - were the full owners of the town.</p>

                <p class="text">The 19th century in Liozno was rich in events: in 1812, the French division of General
                    Marchand stopped here and even opened a hospital, since 1831 numerous fairs were held in the town,
                    and 20 years later a railway was built here. Thanks to this, Liozno began to develop and grow
                    rapidly.</p>
                <p class="text">And although the fire of 1900 and the Great Patriotic War left nothing of the old
                    Liozno, the modern village has a lot to offer guests. The ruins of the old hydroelectric power
                    station on the Moshna River, the 4-meter "Sunichnaya Brama" are ideal places for beautiful photos,
                    and for architecture and history, you should go to Lenina Street, where the Exaltation of the Cross
                    Church and the Museum of Local Lore are located side by side.</p>
                <p class="text">Fans of Marc Chagall especially often come to Liozno. Almost the entire childhood of the
                    artist passed here, and later on many of his canvases he captured the inhabitants and streets of his
                    beloved village.</p>
