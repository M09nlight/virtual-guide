                Here the scientist founded the Botanical Garden, which operated from the very beginning of the 20th century until 1924. Then in the garden there were about 400 species of rare tree species, there was a collection of perennial herbaceous plants, a greenhouse with 300 species of exotic plants, a herbarium, more than 2000 species of medicinal, technical, berry and other plants, a collection of seeds. There was also a botanical museum. Today, only fragments have survived from the botanical garden. But the estate is still alive, and one of the active residents of Vitebsk even tried to restore it.
