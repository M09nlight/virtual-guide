                <h3>Devil's stone</h3>
                <p class="text">In the Shumilinsky district, 750 meters from the village of Gorki (55.192222,
                    29.488611), there is a natural attraction - the largest stone in Belarus. It is called so - Big, but
                    in some sources you can find the names Great or Devil. The dimensions of the iron-shaped stone are
                    11.0 × 5.6 × 2.8 meters. There is an assumption that its underground part is at least three meters
                    deep, and the giant weighs 800 tons. There is a legend according to which one who even accidentally
                    sees the Great Stone will certainly get lost, and will return to it every time.</p>
