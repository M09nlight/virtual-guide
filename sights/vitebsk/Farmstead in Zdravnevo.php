                <p class="text">Repin bought the Zdravnevo estate after the successful sale of the painting "Cossacks write a letter to the Turkish Sultan." A reduced copy of it is now in the manor house, and a full-size copy can be seen at the Vitebsk railway station. The artist came to the estate for the summer season, according to his sketches, the house was completed and repaired. At the same time, alleys and an orchard were planted here - you can see them now. In this house, the master created about 40 works, including "Autumn Bouquet", "Hunter", "Belorus", "On the Western Dvina" and others.</p>
