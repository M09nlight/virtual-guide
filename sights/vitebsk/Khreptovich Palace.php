                <h3>Khreptovich Palace</h3>
                <p class="text">It was erected in the 70s of the XVIII century in the style of a city mansion and
                    consisted of three buildings. The central one was two-story - with halls and offices, living rooms
                    were placed in one-story side wings. Behind the mansion there was a greenhouse with flowers and
                    plants and outbuildings, which partially survived. What the palace looked like in the 19th century,
                    in 1876, Napoleon Orda captured in his album. Now the building of the palace is occupied by a music
                    school, and a children's library operates in the wing.</p>
