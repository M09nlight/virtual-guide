                <h3>CHURCH OF SAINT LAVRENTIA</h3>
                <p class="text">Church of St. Lawrence - a monument of neo-Gothic architecture. It was built in
                    1908-1913.</p>
                <p class="text">The first church of St. Lawrence in Ushachi was built at the Dominican monastery, which
                    was founded in 1716 by Jerome Zhaba and his wife Katarzyna from the Protasevich family. After
                    Ushachi received the Magdeburg rights, St. Lawrence began to be considered the patron of not only
                    the church, but the whole town.</p>

                <p class="text">After the events of 1830-1831. the Dominican monastery was closed, the Church of St.
                    Lawrence became a parish. The uprising of 1863 resulted in the liquidation of the parish. The church
                    has been converted into an Orthodox church. In 1905, the “Manifesto on Strengthening the Principles
                    of Tolerance” came out, and the Catholics of Ushachi managed to obtain permission to restore the
                    parish and build a new church, which was built of red, unplastered brick. The church originally had
                    two towers on the main facade, which, unfortunately, have not been preserved.</p>
                <p class="text">In 1932 the temple was closed. The Catholic parish of Saint Lawrence was revived only in
                    1994. In 2001, the building of the church was returned to believers and restoration work began,
                    which lasted three years.</p>
