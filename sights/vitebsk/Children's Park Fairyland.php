                <p class="text">The children's amusement park "Fairy Land" in Orsha appeared in 2008 and is the same age
                    as its young visitors who come here with their parents. "Fairytale Land" has already been dubbed the
                    Belarusian Disneyland. It used to be an ordinary park, one of many. But after a large-scale
                    reconstruction, a “Fairytale Country” appeared on the map of Orsha, the hospitality of which knows
                    no bounds. The children's amusement park "Fairytale Country" is located on the banks of the Dnieper
                    in a picturesque place, so the park has gained particular popularity among big and small citizens
                    who spend their leisure time there with great pleasure.</p>
                                    <img src="../../images/vitebsk/12_2.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The peculiarity of the park is that its inhabitants are street sculptures, personifying
                    characters from fairy tales, which are usually read to kids by loving parents before going to bed.
                    At the very entrance to the park, there is a sculpture in which a small guest can easily recognize
                    Gulliver. The park is home to cheerful gnomes, the mischievous Three Little Pigs, and even Gena the
                    Crocodile, who plays the harmonica to his friend Cheburashka. The season in Fairytaleland starts on
                    the first of May and ends on the first of October.</p>

                <p class="text">The attractions here are not ultra-modern and extreme, but touching in their simplicity,
                    which will be close to any child who is used to playing on the playground near the house. There you
                    can also find a labyrinth in the form of a giant dinosaur, in which a contented kid will climb in
                    search of a way out; and friendly dolphins, on which, thanks to the springs, it is easy to jump and
                    fool around; and, of course, a grandiose castle from which you can slide down a special slide.</p>

                <p class="text">The children's amusement park "Fairy Land" in Orsha is especially proud of its
                    amphitheater, where curious theatrical performances for every taste are offered to the attention of
                    children and their parents. In the park, you can rent a bike or roller skates to ride through the
                    picturesque places with the breeze. Recently, a monument to Vladimir Karatkevich, who was born in
                    Orsha and wrote many books included in the cultural fund of the Belarusian region, was opened in the
                    park.</p>
