                <p class="text">In 1931, a lime factory was founded near Ruba, around which a factory settlement grew. JSC "Dolomit" is still working, the village also exists. Some of the quarries have already been worked out and flooded, and the largest operating dolomite mining facility is the Gralevo deposit in Roubaix. The quarry has been growing since the 70s of the last century. Having several interconnected sections, it stretched for 2.5 kilometers. And its depth in some places reaches 45 meters.

                <p class="text">One of the shores of Gralevo is accessible for visiting: the development on the south side of the quarry is no longer being carried out and, having walked across the field, you will just be able to look here. To do this, as with any similar object, is to be as careful as possible.</p>

                <p class="text">The picture that opens when looking at the quarry cannot but bewitch. Here you get the feeling of being in the mountains, and it also seems like you are in an Arizona canyon.</p>
