                <p class="text">The first written mention of Tolochin dates back to 1433. At that time, Tolochin was
                    part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For several centuries, the princes of Drutsk owned the city,
                    from the end of the 16th century. - Sapieha, after - Sangushki. In 1604 Lev Sapega founded a church,
                    a school and a hospital in Tolochin. As a result of the First Partition of the Commonwealth in 1772,
                    the border between the Crown of Poland and Russia passed along the Drut River, thereby dividing
                    Tolochin into two parts. The eastern part of the town became part of the Russian Empire and became
                    known as Old or Russian Tolochin, the western part remained part of the Commonwealth until 1793 and
                    was called Zarechny or New Tolochin.</p>
