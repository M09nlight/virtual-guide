                <h3>FACTORY "DNEPROVSKAYA MANUFACTURE" IN DUBROVNO</h3>
                <p class="text">Cloth factory "Dneprovskaya manufactory" in Dubrovno is one of the oldest Belarusian
                    enterprises that processed flax. It operated from 1900 to 1941. The building of red brick, located
                    on the eastern outskirts of the city, not far from the modern flax mill, reminds of those times.
