                <h3>Dokshitsy</h3>
                <p class="text">Dokshitsy is a city in the Vitebsk region, located 200 kilometers from Vitebsk. It is
                    the administrative center of the district of the same name.</p>
                <p class="text">The first mention of the city dates back to 1407. In letters about the villagers subject
                    to tribute, "Dokshichans" are mentioned. At that time it was a small settlement belonging to Voitekh
                    Manivid.</p>

                <p class="text">In the middle of the 17th century, under the influence of general trends in the country,
                    the owner of the village, Stanislav Kishka, built a wooden Catholic church here. Later, under
                    Konstantin Pace, an Orthodox church was also erected here, and a Bernardine monastery appeared in
                    the neighboring settlement.</p>
                <p class="text">After the second partition of the Commonwealth, the town became part of the Russian
                    Empire. The rapid rise of Dokshitsy began by the middle of the 19th century. A branch of the railway
                    passed nearby, crafts and trade began to develop. Several mills, a distillery and a mead factory
                    were built in the town.</p>
