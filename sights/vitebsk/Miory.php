                <h3>Miory</h3>
                <p class="text">The small cozy town of Miory is located 190 kilometers northwest of Vitebsk. The streets of the city, whose population is about 8 thousand people, are spread along the shores of the picturesque Miory Lake</p>

                <p class="text">The city status of Mioram was granted in 1972. However, the history of the city of Miory goes back to the 16th century - the first mention of the estate of Mera, which belonged to the family of the Mirsky princes, dates back to 1514. There are many legends about the origin of the name of the city, one of which says that in ancient times there was a big plague in the village and almost the entire population died out. And the name of the city came from the Belarusian word "Merci".</p>
                <p class="text">The visiting card of the city is the 500-meter embankment in Miory, which is the favorite place for recreation and walks for both residents of the city and its guests. The original layout has also been preserved in Miory - streets with pre-revolutionary buildings abut against the shore of the lake, forming rectangular quarters. The most picturesque corner of the city, which is also liked by tourists who choose to rest in Miory, is a small peninsula with the Hill of Glory.</p>
