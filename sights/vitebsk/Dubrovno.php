                <h3>Dubrovno</h3>
                <p class="text">Today, Dubrovno is a regional center in the Vitebsk region, picturesquely nestled on two
                    banks of the Dnieper and two rivers flowing into it. Just a few centuries ago, watches were made
                    here that were superior in reliability to Swiss ones, and fabrics, the quality of which went down in
                    history.
                </p>
                <p class="text">The area was first mentioned in written sources in 1393, but the settlement itself - in
                    1514, this date was officially taken as the date of the founding of the city.</p>
                <img src="../../images/vitebsk/30_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The history of Dubrovno is connected with two famous families: the Glebovichs and the
                    Potemkins. Thanks to the first family, a stone castle was founded here, and in 1630 a Bernardine
                    monastery was founded.</p>
                <p class="text">For some time, the Sapiehas owned the lands, but they did not leave their mark on the
                    cultural heritage of the city. Prince Grigory Potemkin himself bought Dubrovno from Sapieha and
                    built two factories here in the 80s of the 18th century: the first watch factory in Russia and a
                    braided one. The latter became the basis for the creation of the famous Dnipro Manufactory.
                    Unfortunately, the geographical location and wars forced the production to be moved to the territory
                    of modern Russia.</p>
