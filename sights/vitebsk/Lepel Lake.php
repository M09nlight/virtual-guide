                <h3>Lepel Lake</h3>
                <p class="text">This reservoir is located on the northern outskirts of Lepel. Along its perimeter there
                    are several more settlements: Shunty, Zavidichi, Old Lepel. The lake belongs to the river basin.
                    Ulla. The water surface area is 10.68 km2, which makes it the largest lake in the Lepel region. The
                    maximum depth reaches 33.7 m (10th place among all Belarusian lakes).</p>

                <p class="text">Lake Lepel is surrounded on almost all sides by either urban development or agricultural
                    land. Only bushes and trees stretch along the shore in a narrow strip. There are several beaches
                    (both equipped and "wild"). This is facilitated by predominantly low sandy shores. At the same time,
                    in some places the coast is a cliff. The extended shallow water passes into the bottom lined with
                    sapropel, which is distinguished by a complex relief: the shoals are adjacent to deep depressions.
                    Water transparency can reach 4.2 m.</p>
