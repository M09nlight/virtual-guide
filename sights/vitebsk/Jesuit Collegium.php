                <h3>Jesuit Collegium</h3>

                <p class="text">The complex of the Jesuit Collegium adorns all the photographs of the city. The building
                    was restored in the 17th century. In 1812, the emperor of France, Napoleon Bonaparte, and famous
                    people of Russia of that time stayed here.</p>

                <p class="text">This object does not belong to either a historical or a religious monument, since it has
                    repeatedly become the center of the cultural and political life of society.</p>
                <p class="text">The building was built by order of the Chancellor of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania L.
                    Sapieha in 1604. But already in 1610, King of Poland Sigismund III opened the first educational
                    institution here. After 100 years, the building was rebuilt in stone in the Baroque style. A music
                    school and a pharmacy were opened, a garden was laid out with growing medicinal plants.</p>
                <p class="text">The collegium contained study rooms, archives, canteens, a library and other premises.
                    The decorative clock tower was supplemented by a brick wall, which became the fence of the entire
                    complex, not far from which the red brick church of St. Michael the Archangel was later erected.</p>

                <p class="text">In 1820, the Orsha Collegium was closed by order of Emperor Alexander I, since the
                    activity of the order was prohibited, and the building and all buildings were transferred to the
                    military department.</p>
                <p class="text">For some time the city prison was located here, until 1989. The Catholic church was
                    destroyed. Only at the beginning of the 21st century, reconstruction work began, which was completed
                    by 2014. The collegium opened an art gallery, an exhibition hall and a children's library.</p>
