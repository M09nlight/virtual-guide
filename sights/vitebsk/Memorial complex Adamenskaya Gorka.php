                <p class="text">At the end of 1943 The Red Army launched a frontal pursuit of the enemy, who had
                    entrenched himself on the previously captured lines and offered active resistance. During the fierce
                    battles, the losses on our side, both killed and wounded, were great. More than 50 hospitals of
                    military units that were stationed in the Liozno region were replenished with wounded soldiers.</p>

                    22, 1944), it was found out that the majority of the reburied soldiers are those who took part in
                    military operations in October 1943 - March 1944, partly in June 1944, and died of wounds in the
                    hospitals of the Liozno region.</p>
