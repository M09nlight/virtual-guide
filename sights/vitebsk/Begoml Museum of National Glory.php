                <p class="text">The history of the Begoml Museum of Folk Glory began on May 8, 1970, when it opened its doors to the first visitors. Initially, the exposition was located in the building of the former office of the Begomlsky state farm, but then it moved to a modern building that once belonged to a local landowner named Buglak.</p>
