                <h3>Museum of Folk Architecture and Life of Strochitsy</h3>
                <p class="text">An ideal place if you want to leave the city for the day, adding an educational element to your walk. On the sprawling territory of the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life there is an authentic wooden building from three Belarusian regions: the Central part, the Poozerye and the Dnieper region. There are peasant houses, churches, windmills, and various outbuildings. And there is also a tavern, which still fulfills its direct duties: here you can have a bite to eat with traditional dishes and taste horseradish.</p>
