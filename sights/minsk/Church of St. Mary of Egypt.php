                <p class="text">The Church of Mary of Egypt was built in the retrospective Russian style in 1865. The
                    building of the shrine was designed by Alexey Polozov.</p>
                <p class="text">The construction of the temple was sponsored by patrons, such as Apollo Redkin. A
                    distinctive feature of this parish is that it has been preserved in its original form, without
                    rebuilding and changes. An external feature is the location of the clock in the central tent, which
                    is not at all typical for Orthodox churches.</p>
                <p class="text">The church continued to function even in Soviet times. At present, the architectural
                    appearance of the temple has been slightly changed - in 2017, the sacristies were completed.</p>
