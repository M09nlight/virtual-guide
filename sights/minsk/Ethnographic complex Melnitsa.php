                <p class="text">The ethnographic complex introduces folk Belarusian culture and architecture. Zaslavl was famous for its mills, and at different times there were water, wind, and steam mills. Until today, only a steam flour mill, built in 1910 by Jason Mehedko-Sawicki, has survived.</p>
                <p class="text">According to the original project, the mill was powered by a locomobile, but later it was noticed by an internal combustion engine, and later by an electric motor. In the 1990s, the mill was restored, and it became the central exhibit of the entire ethnographic complex.</p>
