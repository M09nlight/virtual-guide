                <p class="text">The park is located in the village of Dobrenevo. The estate is still under construction. The legend of the emerald sword was taken as the basis. "Malivur" is furnished in a fabulous style - with caves, elf houses and dragons. The main attraction of the park is the dragon Sky, the size of a three-story house.</p>
                <p class="text">First of all, you need to visit the main house, which houses the chambers of the king and queen of the elves. Children can also visit the playground with swings and slides. There will be a cafe on the territory of the attraction, but so far it is also under construction. Entrance for children under three years old is free.</p>
