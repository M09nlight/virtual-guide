                <h3>Ecotrail "Springs of the holy springs"</h3>
                <p class="text">Surprisingly beautiful and not the most hyped location. According to legend, a church once stood on the site of the springs, which then went underground. And instead of it, springs appeared, which the locals called "saints".</p>
                <img src="../../images/minsk/19_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">“Holy springs” is a small (350 m), but very picturesque trail, which consists of wooden decks and bridges thrown over many small streams. This is the most gentle touch to nature: you walk right above the springs, while not invading the life of the ecosystem. And here is a real natural ASMR: streams murmur, birds sing and trees creak very pleasantly.</p>
                <p class="text">There is also a gazebo on the eco-trail where you can linger for a picnic, so do not forget to bring a thermos of tea (or whatever you like to take with you). </p>
