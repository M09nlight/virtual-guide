                <p class="text">The farthest location from Minsk on this list, but you can still drive there and back in
                    a day without difficulty. Moreover, the place is very beautiful and, as they like to say, “as if not
                    in Belarus”: pines, cliffs and water of such colors that no filters are needed for photos later!</p>

                    nature, but of the Belarusian industry - Soligorsk waste heaps.Right hereThere is a detailed
                    itinerary.</p>
