                <h3>Minsk settlement</h3>
                <p class="text">The settlement is located just 10 km from Minsk, not far from the Museum of Folk Architecture and Life. This is an archaeological complex of the 9th-11th centuries, where, according to historical information, ancient Minsk was located. The settlement is not so much about amazing sights, but about the energy of the place itself. Just imagine: it was from these high shafts that the history of the city began! It's nice to escape from the bustle of the city for a couple of hours and just breathe clean air. And be sure to hug the hundred-year-old poplar that towers over the area - they say hugging trees is good.</p>
