                <h3>Park and Manor Hutten-Czapski</h3>
                <p class="text">And this place is for those who want to walk not just in the park, but in the park with history. In the past, Stankovo had many different famous owners, but the place reached its maximum prosperity under the Gutten-Chapskys. It was they who built the manor complex in Stankovo, which has partially survived to this day, and laid out a huge park. The main attraction - a two-story palace in the style of classicism - unfortunately, has not survived to this day. But in the park you can still see some outbuildings, such as a stable or a house for servants. Well, the pearl of the park is, of course, "Skarbchyk" - the former library of Prince Czapsky, which looks like a small medieval castle. The beauty!</p>
