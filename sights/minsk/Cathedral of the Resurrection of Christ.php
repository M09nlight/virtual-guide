                <p class="text">Borisov Cathedral, built in 1874, represents the pseudo-Russian style and is the most prominent representative of this stylistic trend.</p>
                <p class="text">The architect of the temple was Pyotr Merkulov. Later, already at the beginning of the 20th century, according to the project of another architect Viktor Struev, a gate-bell tower was erected. Despite the fact that another architect designed the building, on the whole the style of the ensemble was sustained.</p>
                <p class="text">The cathedral was not damaged even during the Second World War and now remains active, attracting the attention of hundreds of parishioners every day.</p>
