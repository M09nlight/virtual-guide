                <p class="text">The Catholic parish in Budslav appeared long before the construction of the stone church. The ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania donated a piece of land near the Servach River.</p>
                <p class="text">The first temple was erected back in the 1630s, and it formed the basis of the church that can be seen now. This temple was designed by Andreas Kromer. Later, in the 1760s, the church began to be rebuilt with the support of patrons. By the mid-1780s, the rebuilding work was completed. The temple acquired baroque features. Later, the resulting ensemble of buildings becomes a monastery.</p>
                <p class="text">But after 1852, the monastery was closed, the buildings were handed over to the authorities, they were empty and they even began to be dismantled. The Church of the Ascension was recognized as an architectural monument of republican significance.</p>
