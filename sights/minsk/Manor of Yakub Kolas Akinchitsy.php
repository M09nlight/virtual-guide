                <p class="text">Konstantin Mickiewicz, a classic of Belarusian literature, was born in the town (Lithuanian for “dungeons”) of Akinchitsy, who took the pseudonym Yakub Kolas. In Akinchitsy, the writer's house and outbuildings were restored. Among the outbuildings, a barn, a well and a cellar were reconstructed.</p>
                <p class="text">In the estate of Yakub Kolas, exhibits of the peasant life of the 19th century are exhibited. Most of the items belonged to the Mickiewicz family. A visit to the estate will introduce not only the history of the Mickiewicz family, but also the folk life of Belarus.</p>
