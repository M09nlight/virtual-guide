                <p class="text">The manor house of the Czapski family did not survive, but you can still see outbuildings on the estate - an outbuilding, a stable, a barn and a library. The construction of the complex was completed in the 1880s. The buildings of the estate are built in the medieval style.</p>
                <p class="text">The two-story building of the library has a square shape with four towers around the perimeter. On the second floor there is access to the balcony, but it is already pretty dilapidated. The library was equipped with rooms = archives not only for books, but also for paintings, engravings and even weapons.</p>
                <p class="text">Also of the buildings, a part of the gate has been preserved - the entrance gate to the estate and the watchman's house.</p>
