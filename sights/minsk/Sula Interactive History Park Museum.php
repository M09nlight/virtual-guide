                <p class="text">The manor and park complex in Sula is a place where the separation between the present and the past disappears. Previously, a place with such an interesting name belonged to various noble Belarusian, Polish and Lithuanian surnames.</p>
                <p class="text">The last owners of Sula were the Lensky family, and it was under them that this settlement flourished. The Lenskys actively equipped the estate and by the beginning of the 19th century a house, a chapel-tomb, a mill, an ice house, a greenhouse, a smokehouse and even a fountain were built. The manor complex was supplemented with a park. Over time, the manor was destroyed.</p>
                <p class="text">But today, thanks to the reconstruction, some buildings and the house have been restored. In the Park-Museum you can visit the museums of the Lensky family, the museums of noble glory, as well as the medieval quarter and the site dedicated to the Vikings.</p>
