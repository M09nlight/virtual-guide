                <h3>Hydropark of the sanatorium "Sosnovy Bor"</h3>
                <img src="../../images/minsk/13_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">This small miracle of water-architectural thought was built in 1983 according to a
                    special project of Belgiprovodkhoz. The park is located, as it were, on several islands connected by
                    various small bridges, including suspension ones. There is also a long pier where you can sit back
                    and admire the water surface and the swans gliding along it. But the most interesting thing here is
                    the fountains and various water structures scattered in different parts of the complex. A visiting
                    card is a large cascade at the very beginning of the park, behind the pier. Huge streams of water
                    endlessly fall down from a height - sit on the bench opposite and enjoy.
                    Entrance to the park is free, a small beach inside is also free. But in order to use the pavilions
                    for a picnic on the territory of the hydropark, you need to agree in advance with the administration
                    of the sanatorium.
