                <p class="text">This complex is a monument to the Belarusian gentry culture. Dukorsky Maentak belonged to the family of Oshtorpov. Of the entire manor complex, the entrance gate has been preserved - a beautifully decorated gate, as well as an outbuilding in which the museum is located.</p>
                <p class="text">The museum exhibition introduces visitors to the history of Dukora and the Oshtorp family. You can see the estate as it was created only in the painting of the artist Napoleon Orda.</p>
                <p class="text">On the territory of the park complex there is a menagerie where you can not only look at animals, but also treat them with fresh grass. For tourists, the street of craftsmen will also be interesting, where you can try your hand at making handicrafts.</p>
