                <h3>Nalibokskaya Pushcha</h3>
                <p class="text">This is the nearest forest area of huge proportions to Minsk, where, in addition to the impenetrable natural wilderness, there is also something to see. Firstly, here you can go eco-trails. There are several of them, but we suggest paying attention to Belokorets - this trail is not very long, but interactive and inclusive. Along the way, you will meet land art, very cute information stands, and even a game memo that will help you remember the names of the birds that live in the forest. This trail will be especially interesting for children, but adults will also like it.</p>

                <p class="text">If you are drawn to see some other attraction, then you will also find it in the Nalibokskaya Pushcha. In the Vyaloe tract there are the ruins of the estate of Tyshkeviches - an interesting place for those who like to climb abandoned places. The abandoned Lesnoye sanatorium is also living its life not far away. It looks pretty apocalyptic, but if you like to tickle your nerves, that's it. True, it is dangerous to go inside, the building is in disrepair.</p>
                <p class="text">If you are not afraid of moving along the unpaved roads of the forest (and they are all like that there), then you can overpower another 50 km from the estate of Tyszkiewicz to complete the walk with a picnic on the shore of a small but almost perfect round lake Kroman. A very pleasant and secluded place, and the scenery around is a feast for the eyes!</p>
