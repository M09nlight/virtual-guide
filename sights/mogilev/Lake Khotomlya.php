                <p class="text">Khotomlya among the locals is called the Holy Lake and there is a legend about it. Locals believe that in ancient times there was a village with a church in the center in its place.</p>
                <p class="text">Once this village was attacked by enemies, and as was customary, the inhabitants hid in the church and prayed. The Lord heard their prayers, and the temple, together with the people, was swallowed up by the earth, and overflowed into a lake. So the inhabitants were saved from the painful death that was prepared for them by the enemies.</p>
                <p class="text">Both locals and tourists like to relax on the shore of the lake. The coast is equipped for this, first of all, there are convenient slopes, gazebos and other important infrastructure.</p>
