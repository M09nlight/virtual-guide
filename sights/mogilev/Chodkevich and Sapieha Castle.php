                <p class="text">The castle on the banks of the Dnieper was built under Jan Korol Chodkiewicz at the
                    beginning of the 17th century. The fortress was surrounded by a moat and became one of the first
                    stone buildings in Bykhov. But very soon, literally 10 years later, the castle passed to Sapieha.

                <p class="text">Leo Sapieha was closely engaged in strengthening his castle complex and the whole city
                    as a whole. Bykhov Castle has survived many military clashes and conflicts, but currently it lies in
                    ruins, especially after a fire in 2004.</p>
