                <p class="text">St. George's Church in Bobruisk was founded in 1905 by architect Vladimir Chagin. In general, the question of the construction of the cathedral worried the leadership of the Bobruisk fortress since the 60s of the XIX century, but only by the beginning of the XX century the problems were discussed at a sufficient level.</p>
                <p class="text">Construction work continued until 1907. The military built the cathedral. The Church of St. George the Victorious is made in white and among the people it was simply called the "white church". Closer to the 30s of the twentieth century, the Soviet authorities decided to close the temple. Since 1992, the cathedral has been consecrated again and returned to the bosom of the church.</p>
