                <p class="text">The Dnieper is one of the largest rivers in Europe. The river takes its source precisely on the territory of Belarus. The bed of the Dnieper, which can be seen in the Mogilev region, namely in the Shklov region, is considered prehistoric.</p>
                <p class="text">Experts are sure that it is the floodplain of the river, which differs in scale, has been preserved in its original form from the pre-glacial period. In the Mogilev region, the river takes on a winding character and this section is very popular among anglers due to the large number of bream and pike perch.</p>
