                <p class="text">The fortress in Bobruisk was built at the beginning of the 19th century to defend the borders of the Russian Empire. By the time of the Patriotic War of 1812, the Bobruisk Fortress had become an impregnable citadel with eight bastions. After 1812, in the 1830s, the fortifications were still being destroyed.</p>
                <p class="text">The fortress is considered a historical and cultural value of Belarus. After 1825, a prison for political prisoners was located here: it contained convicted Decembrists, rebels who participated in the January Uprising, and so on.</p>
