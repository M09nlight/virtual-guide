                <h3>Potemkin Palace in Krichev</h3>
                <img src="../../images/mogilev/16_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">The main attraction of Krichev is the palace of Grigory Potemkin, who received it as a gift from the Russian Empress already at the end of the 18th century. But Potemkin owned the estate for a short time, after which it passed into the hands of the gentry Jan Golynsky.</p>
                <p class="text">Representatives of the Golynsky family remained the owners of the estate until the revolution. The building was built in the style of classicism, and later pseudo-Gothic exterior elements were added.</p>
                <p class="text">In Soviet times, state institutions were located here, and then the palace was abandoned due to its dilapidated condition. In the early 2000s, the palace underwent reconstruction and in 2008 a museum was opened in it, which you can see on your own today.</p>
