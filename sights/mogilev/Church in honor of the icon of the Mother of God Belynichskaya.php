                <p class="text">Interestingly, the icon of the Mother of God of Belynichskaya was revered as miraculous by both Catholics and Orthodox. For centuries, information has been disseminated about the miracles performed by the image of the Virgin.</p>
                <p class="text">For example, during the war with the Commonwealth in the period from 1654 to 1667, the icon was in the Lyakhovichi fortress and it is believed that it was thanks to it that it was possible to withstand the siege by the army of Ivan Khovansky.</p>
                <p class="text">Until the 1870s, the icon was kept in the Belynichsky church, after which it was reconsecrated to Orthodoxy. Until the 30s of the twentieth century, the icon of the Mother of God was kept in the local history museum, but disappeared from there during the Second World War and was never found.</p>
