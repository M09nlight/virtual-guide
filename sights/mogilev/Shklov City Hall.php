                <p class="text">The Museum of the History of Mogilev was opened in 1992 in the building of the former Bishop's Palace. This building is an architectural monument of the 18th century, built in the Baroque style. In 2008, the museum's expositions were transferred to another building - the new City Hall, built on the site of a 17th-century structure damaged during the Great Patriotic War. The old structure was badly damaged and beyond repair.</p>
                <p class="text">In connection with this, the market square and the town hall, which towered above it, became the center of the urban structure. The town hall was built in 1772, on both sides of it there were shopping arcades and together the whole composition made up a square city square.</p>
                <p class="text">During its long existence, the malls collapsed and in the early 2000s they were rebuilt. Today, a gymnasium is located within the walls of the former Shklov City Hall.</p>
