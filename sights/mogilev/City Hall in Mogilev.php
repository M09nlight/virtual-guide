                <p class="text">Mogilev City Hall is a symbol of the city's self-government. Mogilev accepted the Magdeburg Law back in 1577, after which the building for the city government was built. The first town hall was wooden, so it constantly suffered from fires.
                </p>
                <p class="text">And towards the end of the 17th century, the construction of a stone town hall began. Court sessions were held on the first floor, the magistrate was located, the city council met.</p>
                <p class="text">Time did not spare the building, it burned during the Northern War, suffered during the Second World War, and eventually completely collapsed. The town hall building that can be seen now is a reconstruction erected in the early 2000s.</p>
