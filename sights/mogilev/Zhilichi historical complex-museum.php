                <p class="text">The Zhilichi Historical Museum is located in the former estate of Bulgakov. The
                    construction of the estate was started in the 1820s by the gentry Ignatius Bulgak and continued in
                    subsequent decades.</p>
                <p class="text">As planned by the owner, the palace was supposed to be the brightest and most majestic
                    among the nearby gentry estates. And Ignatius Bulgak was even inspired by Versailles. The architect
                    was the Pole Karol Podchaszynski, a representative of classicism.</p>
                <p class="text">At the time of 2022, the estate, which houses the Zhilichsky Historical Complex-Museum,
                    is under reconstruction.</p>
