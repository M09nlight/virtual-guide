                <p class="text">The Bobruisk water tower differs from other similar structures in that it did not remain abandoned, as is often the case - it even housed a restaurant. It was built in 1927 and was used for its intended purpose until the 60s.</p>
                <p class="text">After that, they decided to organize a restaurant in the building. Already closer to the present time, a glass dome and an elevator have been completed on the roof so that visitors to the catering establishment can enjoy beautiful views of the city.</p>
