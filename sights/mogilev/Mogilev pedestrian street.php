                <h3>Mogilev pedestrian street</h3>
                <p class="text">Mogilev pedestrian street is a place where you will definitely get to and, perhaps, cross it more than once, because it unites the three main Mogilev squares. The street in its current form began to take shape 17 years ago and for Mogilev residents it is not just a tourist attribute, but a city artery - in the morning you can see workers and schoolchildren with students hurrying to work and study, and in the evenings life is seething here. It also attracts street musicians - the closer to the weekend, the more music you will hear.</p>
