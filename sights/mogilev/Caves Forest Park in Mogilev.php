                <p class="text">One of the large forests, which Belarus is so rich in, is located in the valley of one
                    of the tributaries of the Dnieper. A lake has been artificially created on this river, along the
                    banks of which local residents are very fond of walking. The pine-spruce forest is equipped for
                    walks and recreation.</p>
                <p class="text">In the forest there are hotels for guests of the region. In the Pechersk Forest Park,
                    visitors can rent a boat for a boat trip, a bicycle or roller skates to quickly explore the park.
                    You can rent a catamaran or an air mattress.</p>
