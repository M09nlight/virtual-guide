                <p class="text">This memorable place is dedicated to the distant events of the Northern War, since it was at the village of Lesnaya that one of the most important events took place - the battle in 1708. Subsequently, he was called the "mother of the Battle of Poltava", because the army of Charles XII suffered significantly - lost ammunition, suffered heavy human losses.</p>
                <p class="text">The memorial was built for the 200th anniversary of the battle, in 1908. The architect of the chapel, which is the center of the composition, was Alexander von Gauguin, and the sculptures were created by Artemy Ober. The style of the chapel is neoclassicism. It is interesting to consider the second tier. It is decorated with golden ceramic tiles and mosaics.</p>
