                <p class="text">Near the village of Buinichi, the fighting for Mogilev continued for more than 20 days. The center of the memorial complex was the chapel, under which are the remains of the dead soldiers. Inside the chapel on the walls are memorial plaques dedicated to the dead.</p>
                <p class="text">The poet Konstantin Simonov bequeathed to scatter his ashes over the Buinichsky field, so the memorial complex is supplemented with a granite stone dedicated to his memory.</p>
