                    The organization has two branches: an art gallery and an exhibition hall. More than twenty
                    exhibitions take place here every year. The museum fund began to form only in 2004.</p>
                <p class="text">Today the exposition includes five collections: paintings and drawings, photographic
                    materials, arts and crafts, pottery. Since 2014, the permanent unique exhibition of the art museum
                    has become an exposition of rocks in 1000 exhibits.</p>
