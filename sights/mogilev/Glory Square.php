                <h3>Glory Square</h3>
                <p class="text">Glory Square, which was Soviet for a long time, has changed dramatically in recent years. This is a real place of power for the people of Mogilev themselves. The view that opens up on the Dnieper and the region beyond the river is conducive to contemplation and reflection on important life issues. But if there are none in your life at the moment, you can go down to look at the Dnieper closer and take a selfie with the Mogilev lions that appeared on the bridge after its reconstruction. Before you reach them, you will see an underground passage, on the walls of which important moments from the history of the city are depicted.</p>
