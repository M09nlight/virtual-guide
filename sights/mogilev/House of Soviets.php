                <h3>House of Soviets</h3>
                <p class="text">Minsk residents like to say that this building is very similar to the Minsk Government House, but this is not entirely true. Despite the fact that the building of the Mogilev regional executive committee - namely, this authority is now located here - has enough similarities with its older brother, there are enough differences in details. The building began to be built in 1938 after the plans of the Soviet government to move the capital from Minsk to Mogilev. And if not for the war, it is not known how the fate of the city would have developed further. The plans were not destined to come true and now the city has a real metropolitan building, which was the dominant in the post-war restoration, and now, in addition to the practical functions of the government, is an architectural monument.</p>
