                <p class="text">The Catholic church belonged to the Dominican order. Now it is in a ruined state, its ruins can be seen in the village of Knyazhitsy. The construction of the church lasted about 30 years, from about the 1750s to the 80s of the same century.</p>
                <p class="text">The interior of the church has not survived at all. Visitors can see only stucco on the walls, some barely preserved elements of interior decoration. The walls of the church are supported by wooden beams, and the ceiling is constantly sprinkled. Therefore, to see the remains of the temple, you need to hurry.</p>
