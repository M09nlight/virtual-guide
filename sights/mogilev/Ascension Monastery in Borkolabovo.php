                <p class="text">The founder of the convent was the politician and Orthodox patron of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania Bogdan Wilhelmovich Stetkevich in 1623. Later, the shrine received a miraculous icon of the Mother of God as a gift from Prince Dmitry Pozharsky, so the Ascension Monastery rapidly became one of the centers of religious life.</p>
                <p class="text">The ancient Ascension Church was seriously damaged during a fire in the 19th century, after which it was rebuilt. In the post-revolutionary period, they decided to completely destroy the monastery: they destroyed outbuildings, removed domes, and so on. The revival of the monastery began in 2008, but the work is still not finished.</p>
