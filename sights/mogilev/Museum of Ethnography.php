                <p class="text">In 1981, the Mogilev Museum of Ethnography was opened. It belongs to the Mogilev Regional Museum of Local Lore. Initially, the museum exposition was placed in a wooden house built in the early 20th century.</p>

                <p class="text">Today the museum building is located in the historical part of the city of Mogilev on its main street. The main exposition "The Earth's Native Cycle" was opened in 1996 and presented calendar ceremonies and national holidays of the region.</p>
                <p class="text">Visitors will be interested in exhibits that demonstrate the life of peasants in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Another exposition - "Provincial Mogilev" - is dedicated to the history of urban estates in different periods of history.</p>
