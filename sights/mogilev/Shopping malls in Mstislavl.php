                    Belarus. In the distant 17th century, a Jewish shopping center was located in their place, which was
                    later destroyed by fire. Therefore, at the beginning of the 20th century, it was decided to build a
                    stone structure on this site.

                <p class="text">The sights were built in the eclectic style - a combination of modern and neoclassical.
                    In the second half of the twentieth century, due to uselessness and dilapidated state, part of the
                    rows was demolished. Then, archaeological research was even carried out on this territory.</p>
