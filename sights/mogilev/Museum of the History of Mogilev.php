                <p class="text">The Museum of the History of Mogilev was opened in 1992 in the building of the former Bishop's Palace. This building is an architectural monument of the 18th century, built in the Baroque style. In 2008, the museum's expositions were transferred to another building - the new City Hall, built on the site of a 17th-century structure damaged during the Great Patriotic War. The old structure was badly damaged and beyond repair.</p>
