                <h3>Braslav </h3>

                <p class="text">Braslav is probably the most renowned resort town in Belarus. It's surrounded by lakes, has a rich history, and hosts Viva Braslav – one of the most popular summer festivals in the country. Back in 1500, Princess Elena, the daughter of the Grand Duke of Moscow Ivan III Vasilyevich and the wife of the Grand Duke of Lithuania Aliaksandr Jahielončyk, set her heart on the village. And today Braslav captivates tourists from all over Belarus (and other places as well).</p>
                <p class="text">There is plenty of entertainment in Braslav: you can ride a wakeboard or a yacht, rent a kayak and bicycles, book a boat tour or learn how to handle a sailboat. Almost all of the activities are available at the sports club Drivyatich (55.637318, 27.039159). The club also runs a sailing school BraslaWave, where you can book a boat trip or even take a five-day yacht-sailing training course.</p>

                <p class="text">Braslaŭ offers splendid panoramas as well: the Castle Hill has a spectacular view of the city, Belmont Park preserves ruins of a palace, an old chapel and century-old trees (look up for information in our guide, and if you are not in the mood to plan the route yourself, go straight to the club Drivyatich – they will help you).</p>

                <p class="text">The city is surrounded by three lakes – Naviaty, Biareza and Dryviaty. And there are a dozen more water reservoirs nearby. Taken all round, it is an ideal location for camping, recreation and a chill weekend. Especially at times when the choice of places to travel due to the pandemic is limited.</p>
