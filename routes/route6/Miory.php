                <p class="text">If you stay in the Mereya camping, don't miss a chance to visit Miory as a cultural
                    program.</p>
                <p class="text">The main tourist location of the city is the Catholic Church of the Assumption of the
                    Virgin Mary. This neo-Gothic building was erected in 1907. The location on the shore of Lake Miory
                    gives special picturesqueness to the Church. By the way, there is a legend connected with the lake:
                    people say that once a sculpture of the Virgin Mary was submerged in its waters. Since then, it
                    seems to be constantly looking for new “victims”. But it's up to you to believe the story or not.

                <p class="text">Every year in September, Miory hosts an ecological festival with excursions,
                    competitions, master classes and other entertainments. It's centered around the Jeĺnia swamp, which
                    is located on the territory of the Miory and Šarkaŭščyna districts. Unfortunately, it won't be
                    possible to participate in the event before the fall. But there's always a possibility to visit the
                    swamps.</p>
                <p class="text">Also, there is a cozy park Peninsula with nice panoramic views in the city, as well as
                    several houses of the early twentieth century and three museums – the Museum of local history, the
                    ethnographic one and the Museum of books and printing – it stores more than 30,000 artifacts. By and
                    large, the cultural program is furnished.</p>
