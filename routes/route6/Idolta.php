                <p class="text">Then we recommend you to drop by the town of Idolta. An intense architectural walk awaits you here: the route includes a church, a chapel-tomb, a vicarage and a manor house. Once these lands belonged to the Rudomin-Dusiackis, then to the Sapiehas, later they passed into the possession of Judge Jazep Miloš and his son. The last owners erected most of the buildings here – and the quality of the latter was high. Almost all of them are preserved in excellent condition.</p>

                <p class="text">Another cool attraction is located not far from Idolta – a waterfall on the Viata River. It is a popular check-in point for all local travelers and a great place for a picnic with friends. There is a well-equipped area with alcoves, benches and tables near the waterfall. Worth a look along the way.</p>
