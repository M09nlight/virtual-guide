                <p class="text">If you prefer small and cozy places, after a visit to Braslav head to Slabodka – it is the “light” version of the popular resort. There are fewer people and less infrastructure, but more lakes and cool vistas. Besides, it is, according to tourists, the most picturesque place in the vicinity – so it is definitely a must-see.</p>
                <p class="text">All the best attractions in Slobodka are natural. And they begin at the entrance to the agro-town. So, near the turn to the village of Litovshchina there is an unusual lake of God's eye - miniature and round - very beautiful. And a little further - Devil's Pit - a glacial depression that has already become a popular tourist attraction.</p>

                <p class="text">Slobodka is surrounded by five lakes, and an ecological trail stretches along them for 4.6 kilometers. Here you can retire, slow down and get lost. And in Slobodka there is a real architectural gem of Belarus - the Church of the Heart of Jesus built in 1906. The feeling that you are in Paris, and not in a small village.</p>
