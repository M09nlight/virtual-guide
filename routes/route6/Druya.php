                <p class="text">The next place is also an amazing one and is located on the border with the EU. Druja lies on the very edge of Belarus â€“ on the left bank of the Western Dvina River. The right bank is Latvian lands.</p>
                <p class="text">At the time of the Polack Principality, life in Druja was in full swing. Back then this settlement stood on an important trade route. Now the town looks very calm and secluded. The main meditative location is the bank of the Western Dzvina. It will definitely appeal to those who miss traveling.</p>

                <p class="text">In addition to the favorable location and absolute tranquility, Druja also has plenty of attractions. Among our favorites is the Catholic Church of the Holy Trinity, the Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, the Jewish cemetery and an abandoned manor house of the XIX century.</p>
