                <h3>Palace of the Rumyantsevs and the Paskeviches in Gomel </h3>
                <img src="../../images/routes/route1/5_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">

                <p class="text">In the late 18th century the Belarusian lands were part of the Russian Empire. Empress
                    Catherine the Great gave Gomel to her favorite, General Field Marshal Piotr Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky,
                    for his outstanding victories in the war against Turkey. On the bank of the River Sozh there was a
                    wooden castle, which had earlier belonged to Michal Fryderyk Czartoryski, the Grand Chancellor of
                    Lithuania. Piotr Rumyantsev had the wooded castle demolished and a new one built. The construction
                    of the castle in the style of early Classism began in 1777, with prominent architects of that time
                    Y.N. Alekseyev, K.I. Blank, Y.M. Felten, M.K. Mostsepanov advising on its design.</p>
                <p class="text">The last owner of the Gomel estate was Duchess Irina Paskevich, a patron, a
                    philanthropist and a translator. She made the first translation of Leo Tolstoyâ€™s War and Peace into
                    French. Later the residence, its rich library and collections became part of the Museum of Art and
                    History which was opened in 1919. The palace was destroyed and restored several times. It suffered
                    the most severe damage during an uprising in 1919 and the Great Patriotic War. Throughout its
                    history the palace was used for various purposes. It housed a telephone station, a library, a puppet
                    theater, a youth center and a museum.</p>
                <img src="../../images/routes/route1/5_2.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Today the former residence of the aristocrats in Gomel is one of the most interesting
                    and frequently visited Belarusian museums and a major historical, cultural and educational center.
                    The ground floor of the central part of the palace has exactly the same interior as in the past
                    thanks to the meticulous restoration based on historic documents. This part of the palace still
                    houses Column Hall, White Living Room, Red Living Room and a hall of ceremonies (former Golden
                    Dining Room). These halls are not merely a part of the exposition. They are also used for balls,
                    concerts and meetings attended by top officials from different countries. The Gomel palace also
                    hosts picture, photo and other kinds of exhibitions and interesting educational projects.</p>
