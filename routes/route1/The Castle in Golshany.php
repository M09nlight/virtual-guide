                <p class="text">Halshany (Golshany) is a small agrotown in the Grodno Region with a rich history and serious heritage. It is often called the “open-air museum”, and it is absolutely true. The castle in Halshany is the ancestral home of the Halshany and later the Sapieha dynasties. Nearby is the 17th century Baroque church, with typical 19th century houses lining the streets. Prior to World War II, most of the population of Halshany was Jewish. There was also a synagogue and a Jewish bank, which unfortunately have not survived.</p>
                <p class="text">According to chronicles, the castle had existed here since at least 1280 and belonged to the dukes of Halshany. In 1525, the two famous families merged – Helena of Halshany married the magnate Pawel Sapieha. The Halshany castle owes its new stone appearance to Pawel. For grandeur of exterior and interior decoration, for integrity of the architectural concept in XVII century the Halshany castle was deservedly considered one of the most beautiful in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. Not far from the castle Pawel Sapieha built a Catholic Franciscan monastery and a church. Unfortunately, the architectural ensemble has survived in its sad state. The monastery and church have somehow survived, but the castle was almost destroyed.
