                <h3>The Nesvizh Castle (Palace)</h3>
                <img src="../../images/routes/route1/2_.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">

                <p class="text">The construction was initiated by Mikołaj Krzysztof Radziwiłł in 1583. There is no
                    accurate information regarding who designed the castle. Some speculate that Mikołaj Krzysztof
                    Radziwiłł designed the project himself, and some researches state that an Italian architect
                    Bernardoni took part in the construction at some stages.</p>
                <p class="text">From the 16th to the 20th century the palace was the residence of one of the richest and
                    most noble dynasties in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania – Radziwiłł. Kings of Poland and other upper
                    class families regularly paid visits to the mansion.
                </p>

                <p class="text">Since the palace was rebuilt several times, it features multiple styles of architecture:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>neo-gothic;</li>
                    <li>baroque;</li>
                    <li>classicism;</li>
                    <li>modernism;</li>
                    <li>renaissance;</li>
                    <li>rococo.</li>
                </ul>
                <img src="../../images/routes/route1/2_2.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">In 1764 and 1768, the palace was occupied by Russian troops because of the anti-Russian stance of its landlord Ling Stanisław “the Pious” Radziwiłł. Family’s possessions were confiscated, including a huge collection of over 10,000 books and an archive, which were taken out to Saint Petersburg. Many of the works of art were distributed among Russian upper class.</p>
                <p class="text">Nesvizh is among the most beautiful palaces of Belarus and every year draws thousands of visitors. The landscaped garden with lovely lakes and shady pathways deserve particular attention.</p>
                <p class="text">In general, there are 5 parks that occupy 66 hectares:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>English Park;</li>
                    <li>Castle Park;</li>
                    <li>Japanese Park;</li>
                    <li>Marysin Park;</li>
                    <li>Old Park.</li>
                </ul>
