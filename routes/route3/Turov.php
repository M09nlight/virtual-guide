                <p class="text">Turov (Russian: Turow, Lithuanian: Turava, Belarussian: Tura≈≠) is one of the oldest Belarusian cities and was once the cultural and economic centre of the Dregoviches (Lithuanian period). Turov was first mentioned in a document in 980, but its history began much earlier. During the Kievan Rus period, Turov was one of the largest cities, the capital of a partial principality, and one of the most important cultural and religious centres of the Eastern Slavs. The favourable geographical location of the city along important trade routes was one of the reasons why it was attacked and burned several times. The city was rebuilt again and again, but unfortunately many sights have not been preserved until today. Today Turov is a peaceful small town in the southeast of Belarus, situated directly at the river Pripyat.</p>

                <p class="text">During a city tour you will visit this picturesque gem. Among other things, you will see the famous stone crosses, which grow out of the earth and are a symbol of God's grace throughout Belarus. Many Belarusians come to Turov to touch the stones and receive blessings.</p>
