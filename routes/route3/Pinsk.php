                <p class="text">Pinsk, one of the largest towns in southern Belarus, an ancient cultural, spiritual and
                    historical center, has been known for more than nine centuries. It was first mentioned in chronicles
                    on 5 November 1097. Pinsk was an influential town and always fascinated visitors by its beauty and
                    uniqueness. Today the unofficial capital of the Polesie region is home to more than 160 historical
                    sites which make up a unique urban ensemble. Pinsk yields only to the ‘royal city’ of Grodno in
                    terms of the number of architectural monuments. Rich heritage, amazing nature and unique cultural
                    identity of the locals known as Poleshuks distinguish Pinsk among other cities of the country.

                <p class="text">A long time ago the Pina River was part of a long route between the Baltic Sea and the
                    Black Sea together with the famous Pripyat, the Yaselda and the Bug. The town itself became a
                    buzzing port harboring merchant ships and even had a boat market. Today, if you walk from the
                    building of the college down to the embankment, you will get directly to the old river terminal - a
                    specimen of Polesie wooden architecture. The port-terminal is open during a tourist season,
                    therefore you can take a river trip on the Pinskmotor ship or go on a big cruise across Polesie, the
                    only one of this kind in Belarus. The Belaya Rus river journey connects Brest and Mozyr and passes
                    through Pinsk.</p>
