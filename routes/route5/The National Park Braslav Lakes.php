                <p class="text">The Braslav Lakes National Park is one of the youngest, but truly unique and well-known far beyond the borders of the country. It is located in the extreme north-west of the Republic of Belarus in the province with the poetic name "Belarusian Lakeland". From the first acquaintance, this region amazes with the incredible beauty of post-glacial landscapes and the endless expanse of numerous lakes, an amazing combination of which create a unique recognizable image of the Braslav region.</p>
                <p class="text">The Braslav Lakes National Park is a model of the landscapes of the Baltic Poozerie, which arose as a result of the last glaciation. After the melting of the Poozersk glacier, which covered the territory of Belarus 15-14 thousand years ago, deep lake basins were formed with a complex indented coastline and labyrinths of channels and bays, alternating with hills, unique forms of young glacial relief - kams and ozes. This is a unique national park, which has no equal among the CIS countries.</p>
