                <p class="text">The majority of guests arriving in Minsk can’t but notice the memorial complex «the
                    Mound of Glory» along the way from the airport to the capital. It is located in the 21-st km M2 road
                    Minsk-the national airport «Minsk».</p>
                <p class="text">The «Mound of Glory» was constructed by the descendants in honor of the great victory.
                    The creation of it began in 1967. At that time every person felt honored to bring a handful of soil
                    for the creation of the memorial monument and to render homage to the victors.</p>
                <p class="text">The construction of the Mound of Glory was under the control of architects, sculptors,
                    engineers and painters in Belarus. A solemn opening of the memorial took place in 1969, and since
                    then people have been coming to lay flowers in the victors’ honor and to remember those who didn’t
                    make it.</p>
