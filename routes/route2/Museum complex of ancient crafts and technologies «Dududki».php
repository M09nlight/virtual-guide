By visiting it, guests of the museum can learn about the history of the creation and the principle of operation of the "windmill". The height of the mill is 14 meters. It was built in 1905 by brothers Mikhail and Ivan Polyakov from Berezovka, Gomel region. At the time of collectivization, the brothers were exiled to Siberia, and the mill became owned by collective farms. In the 20th century, it did not work and gradually came to ruin. When the museum was created, it was decided to move the mill to the territory of the complex and carry out work on its restoration.</p>
