                <p class="text">The exhibition of the museum introduces with traditional peasant art of the 16 - early 20th century and with works of modern masters, working in the most wide-spread type of the public art - weaving, pottery, carving and painting on wood, straw wickerwork and vines. The exhibits are in the closet-shop window of 2 meter height. Six small carrying shop windows breaks certain monotony of the utter shop-front line. The pews with cross-bar backs, decorated by carving occupy middle of the hall. The pews were organically inserted in the interior and terminated the decoration of the whole hall. When designing the museum it was immediately provided possibility for organization of the concerts. On the white background of the walls the dark furniture looks solemnly. The upper belt is more light: four forged chandeliers, solved in tradition of old-time lighting armature of the cult buildings, and stained-glass windows. The strict color combination of the black chandeliers and light arcs brighten the multi-coloured stained-glass windows, on coloring very close to the national folk weaving.</p>
