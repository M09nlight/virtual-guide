                <h3>Bar "Viking"</h3>
                <img src="../../../images/eat/gomel/22.jpg" alt="" class="image-block">
                <p class="text">Pervomayskaya street, 1, Zhlobin</p>
                <p class="text">tel. 8 029 174-01-07</p>
                <p class="text">Very nice and pleasant interior, although a little cramped. The bar is located on the ship of a small old boat, which stands on the ground in the park. Outside, they made a beautiful summer terrace made of solid wood. The menu contains mostly large portions, which can well satisfy your hunger. The bad reputation was explained by the fact that a few years ago, under the old owner, there were bad orders, but now everything is strict and at a good level.</p>
                <p class="text">The hall of the renovated bar is now beautiful and spacious. Thanks to the large windows, you can admire the nature of Zhlobin Park. It is also worth noting the friendly staff. And traditionally - large and tasty portions. The big advantage of the Viking bar is that it works on weekends, while most other establishments are closed for special services.</p>
                <p class="text">Vegetarian food: Yes.</p>
                <p class="text">Children's menu: There is ice cream, sometimes there are cakes.</p>
                <p class="text">Pre-order: There is no pre-order on weekends and holidays, as well as on Friday after 18:00. There is no table reservation by phone. Order on weekdays 2 days in advance and only up to 12 people. As an exception, reservations for a couple of tables are possible on weekends.</p>
                <p class="text">Music: Player.</p>
                <p class="text">Toilet: In a separate building on the street, not very pleasant.</p>
