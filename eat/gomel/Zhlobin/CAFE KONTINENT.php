                <p class="text">Zhlobyn, ul. K. Marksa, 52</p>
                <p class="text">Friday, Saturday: 12:00 - 02:00</p>
                <p class="text">A new cafe opened on the third floor of the supermarket of the same name. With a
                    beautiful rich interior. But the hall is poorly divided into zones and the atmosphere of a dining
                    room is created (the whole hall is in the palm of your hand). There is a small stage with music
                    equipment, from which entertainment programs (not cheap) are often broadcast. In general, there was
                    a pleasant impression, but there is a lack of internal organization, perhaps this will pass with
                    time.</p>
                    <p class="text">Vegetarian food: There are a couple of dishes on the menu, you can ask to exclude certain ingredients.</p>
                    <p class="text">Children's menu: You can order dishes designed especially for children. There is ice cream, you can order a cake or pastries. On Sundays there are children's parties.</p>
                    <p class="text">Pre-order: It is necessary to book a table no later than a week in advance and 4 days in advance to negotiate an order with an advance payment of 100 - 300 thousand per person. The entire hall can accommodate 64 people and its rental requires a minimum order of 600 thousand rubles. When ordering a wedding, a loaf and musical accompaniment as a gift.</p>
                    <p class="text">Music: Player with high-quality pleasant music, various events are organized periodically in the evenings with a separate entrance fee.</p>
                    <p class="text">Toilet: Clean, very nice and comfortable.</p>
