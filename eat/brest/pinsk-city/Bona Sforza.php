                <p class="text">Almost in the very center of Pinsk, not far from the main square of the city, there is a cozy cafe "Bona Sforza". This unique establishment received its first visitors only a year ago, but in such a short time it has already fallen in love with the residents of our city. Here they communicate and get acquainted, exchange the latest news and just mentally spend time with delicious conversations.

                <p class="text">The restaurant is distinguished by a special atmosphere filled with the spirit of the old city. The walls of the cafe are decorated with many photographs that reflect the life of the capital of Polissya and its inhabitants, and the interior decoration, executed in retro style, only contributes to a good rest.</p>
