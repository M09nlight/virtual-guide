                <p class="text">The bar "Derevensky Dvorik" has been working in the agro-town of Parkhimovtsy for the
                    second year. It's nice to come here, everything is stylized as an old village hut and courtyard.
                    Wood, stone, clay, rural household items create a special and unique flavor. The view is attracted
                    by the whitewashed stove, as if you were in a peasant's hut of the past centuries. It makes you want
                    to sit on a wide comfortable bench at a cozy table. And the villagers willingly come to their bar,
                    celebrate holidays, anniversaries, weddings here.</p>
