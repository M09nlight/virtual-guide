                                This option is interesting in that in addition to ordinary rooms, there is the
                                possibility of accommodation in a hostel, in a dormitory room. The price of a bed is
                                about €10.</p>

                            <p class="text-left-30">This is perhaps not the most glamorous and convenient option in
                                terms of communication, but definitely exotic. Imagine, in a typical urban development
                                area, one of the Khrushchevs turns out to be quite a hotel. Where the reception is
                                located in the first entrance, and your number may be, say, in the fourth. But here it
                                is quite budgetary, many rooms have a kitchen and everything you need for a long stay.
