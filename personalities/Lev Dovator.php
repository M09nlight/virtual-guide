                <p class="text">In August 1941, he was entrusted to lead a separate cavalry group, formed from several
                    cavalry regiments. Under the command of L.M. Dovator, a large cavalry unit for the first time made a
                    raid into the enemy rear from August 14 to September 2, 1941, striking at communications, destroying
                    the headquarters, transport, warehouses and manpower of the Nazis.</p>
                <p class="text">The advanced parts of the corps were already in the area of the village of Palashkino
                    (Ruzsky district of the Moscow region), where there were large forces of the Nazis. Opposite the
                    village, under the steep bank of the river, L.M. Dovator placed the field headquarters of the corps
                    and, having decided to personally inspect the location of the enemyâ€™s defenses before the attack,
                    climbed to the opposite bank of the river. The Nazis, noticing a crowd of people, hit from a machine
                    gun. Major-General Dovator was killed on the spot... In a stubborn and fierce battle, the Cossacks
                    surrounded the village of Palashkino and defeated an important enemy defense center.</p>
