                <p class="text">Napoleon Orda traveled extensively in Belarus, Ukraine, Lithuania and Poland. Everywhere he made sketches of various places. Today, his works serve as a valuable source for architectural historians and restorers, they are distinguished by thorough documentation. Many architectural monuments captured by the painter no longer exist or have changed a lot.</p>
