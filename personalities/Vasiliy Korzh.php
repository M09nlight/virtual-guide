                <p class="text">On June 28, 1941, in the area of the village of Posenichi, the first battle was fought
                    by a partisan detachment under the command of V.Z. Korzh. To protect the city from the north side, a
                    group of partisans was placed on the Pinsk-Logishin road. A partisan detachment commanded by Korzh
                    was ambushed by 2 German tanks. It was reconnaissance of the 293rd Wehrmacht Infantry Division. The
                    partisans opened fire and knocked out one tank. As a result of this operation, they managed to
                    capture 2 Nazis. It was the first partisan battle of the first partisan detachment in the history of
                    the Great Patriotic War.</p>
