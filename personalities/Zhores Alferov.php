                <p class="text">Academician Zhores Alferov is the winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics for 2000. He is
                    one of the greatest scientists of our time in the field of semiconductor technology, his works are
                    widely known and recognized worldwide, included in textbooks and monographs. Almost every inhabitant
                    of the planet daily uses the scientific developments of Zhores Alferov. All mobile phones have
                    heterostructural semiconductors created by him. Without the "Alferov laser" CD players and disk
                    drives of modern computers would be impossible. His discoveries are used in car headlights, traffic
                    lights, and supermarket equipment - product label decoders.</p>
