                <p class="text">Vseslav Charogdey is the legendary prince of Polotsk, who ruled from 1044 to 1101.
                    According to legend, his birth was associated with pagan witchcraft, he could turn into a wolf and
                    quickly cover long distances â”€ for this reason the nickname Sorcerer appeared.</p>
                <p class="text">By order of the ruler, St. Sophia Cathedral was built in Polotsk. Vseslav was the hero
                    of the famous poem "The Tale of Igor's Campaign", the first annalistic mention of Minsk is also
                    associated with him. In the late 1060s, the princes of Kyiv invited Vseslav the Enchanter to
                    negotiate and imprisoned him in Kyiv. Soon, as a result of the uprising, the people of Kiev released
                    him and declared him a Kyiv prince. He stayed on the throne for 7 months, and then returned to the
                    Principality of Polotsk, which, after his death, was divided into several destinies.</p>
