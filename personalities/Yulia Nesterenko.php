                <p class="text">At the 2004 Games in Athens, the athlete in the final race for 100 meters, unexpectedly
                    for many experts and analysts, was ahead of more eminent runners and finished first with a score of
                    10.93 and won a medal of the highest dignity. At that moment in time it was (and continues to be so)
                    almost an outstanding result. Largely because the 100-meter distance for both men and women is
                    considered “royal”, and the absolute power on it belongs to the Americans or the inhabitants of the
                    Caribbean.</p>
