                <p class="text">Melezh's first poem "Radzime" was published in 1939 in "Chyrvonai Zmena". Before the
                    war, he was published in the newspapers “Litaratura and Mastatstva”, “Balshavik Palessya” and
                    others. </p>
                <p class="text">A key place in the entire work of Melezh is occupied by the trilogy "Palesian Chronicle"
                    ("People on Balots", "Dykh Bulk", "Zavei. Snezhan"). In the trilogy, the author describes his native
                    places and talks about the life of a small village during the period of collectivization. The most
                    important thing that the writer managed in the trilogy is to reveal the images of his characters.
                    Each of them is unique in its own way, with its own character and habits.</p>
