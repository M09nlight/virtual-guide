                    Vladimir Omelyanyuk was one of the founders of the underground printing house during the Nazi
                    occupation of Minsk, the editor of the first issue of the underground newspaper Zvyazda.

                    Omelyanyuk acted as part of the Komarovskaya underground group: he wrote leaflets, reproduced and
                    distributed reports of the Sovinformburo, maintained contact with the partisan detachments of the
                    Minsk region, and participated in the release of prisoners of war from death camps. After the
                    release of the first underground issue of Zvyazda, the Nazis announced a reward of 75,000 marks to
                    whoever indicated where the newspaper was printed. In May 1942, German agents tracked down
                    Omelyanyuk, but failed to capture him. An underground worker died in a shootout near the Red Church.
