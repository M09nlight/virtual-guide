                <p class="text">In 1517 in Prague, for the first time in the history of the Eastern and Southern Slavs,
                    Skorina printed the Bible in a language accessible to the common people. In 1525, his "Apostle" was
                    published, and later â”€ "A Small Road Book". The activities of Skaryna left a significant mark in the
                    history of Belarus. Today, numerous streets, educational institutions, libraries in different
                    countries are named after him. Monuments to the pioneer printer stand in many cities. The first
                    monument in Belarus dedicated to the enlightener appeared in his hometown of Polotsk in 1974.</p>
