                    From the first days of the occupation of the capital, the young Minsker was actively involved in the
                    work of the Minsk underground. At first she went to the Drozdy concentration camp - she brought food
                    and water to the prisoners. She even managed to get and transfer to the hospital a camera (for which
                    execution was already relied on) for making fake documents. Maria also distributed reports from the
                    Information Bureau on the situation on the fronts. Thanks to the courage of the young underground
                    worker, more than a dozen Red Army soldiers were taken out of the hospital and transported across
                    the front line.

                    On October 14, 1941, Maria Bruskina was arrested. Twelve days later, a demonstrative execution of
                    twelve underground workers was carried out in Minsk, among which was a seventeen-year-old
                    schoolgirl.
