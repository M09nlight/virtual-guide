                <p class="text">While in St. Petersburg, Pashkevich participated in Belarusian circles and began to
                    publish in illegal publications. Returning to her homeland, she became one of the leaders of the
                    Belarusian socialist community, for which she ended up in exile. Aloiza Pashkevich was able to
                    return to Belarus only after getting married and changing her last name. For some time she played in
                    the theater of Ignat Buinitsky, edited the magazine "Luchynka".</p>
                <p class="text">Several collections of her poems have been published. The most famous are “Christ for
                    Freedom”, “Belarusian Violin”, a book for children “The First Reading for Belarusian Zetak”.</p>
