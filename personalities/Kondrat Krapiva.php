                <p class="text">Kondrat Krapiva began his career as a satirist poet. His first printed work ─ a
                    feuilleton in verse "Once upon a time" was published in the newspaper "Krasnoarmeyskaya Pravda" in
                    1922. The first work of Nettle in the Belarusian language ─ the satirical poem "Matchmakers" ─
                    appeared in the newspaper "Savetskaya Belarus" on May 23, 1922. From that time on, his conscious
                    literary work began. In the mid-1920s, the first collections of the poet "Astse" and "Nettle" were
                    published.</p>
                <p class="text">Kondrat Krapiva was a member of the literary associations Maladnyak and Uzvyshsha.</p>
