                <p class="text">Yan Barshchevsky as a poet was formed under the influence of Polish classicism.
                    Mickiewicz's passion for poetry was reflected in his Polish works (the poem "The Life of an Orphan",
                    the sonnets "Pilgrim's Melodies").</p>
                <p class="text">The main creation of the author is a collection of fantastic works from the life of the
                    Belarusian hinterland "Shlyakhtich Zavalnya, or Belarus in fantastic stories" in 4 volumes
                    (1844-1846). The works were written under the obvious influence of Belarusian folklore. Barshchevsky
                    used plots of fairy tales and legends of the "wild northern region of Belarus", poeticized his
                    native places, including Lake Nescherdo, near which was the village of Murogi, where he spent his
                    childhood.</p>
