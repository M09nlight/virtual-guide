                <p class="text">Mikhail Savitsky is the only person of art who became the Hero of Belarus. This is an
                    artist whose name is inextricably linked with the main tragedies of our land of the 20th century -
                    the Second World War and the Chernobyl tragedy.</p>
                <p class="text">His works are done in a "severe" style. Their main theme is war and the tragedy of the
                    whole people. All the pictures show how deeply the memories of concentration camps cut into the soul
                    of the artist. An important theme in his work is the Chernobyl tragedy. In total, during his life,
                    Savitsky created more than 200 paintings.</p>
