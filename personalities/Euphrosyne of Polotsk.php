                <p class="text">Euphrosyne of Polotsk is an East Slavic educator, the first woman in Belarus to be
                    recognized as a saint. She was born in Polotsk in 1104, was the granddaughter of Vseslav Charodey
                    and Vladimir Monomakh on the paternal and maternal lines. The secular name of the princess is
                    Predslava. At the age of 12, she decided to abandon the dynastic marriage and went to the monastery.

                <p class="text">Euphrosyne of Polotsk founded monasteries for women and men in her native city. Thanks
                    to her efforts, the Polotsk chronicle was kept, the library of St. Sophia Cathedral was replenished
                    with new editions. She is also known as a philanthropist; the Church of the Holy Savior was built at
                    her expense - it is there that the relics of the saint are now stored. Also, by order of Euphrosyne
                    of Polotsk, a unique cross was created, named after her. It disappeared during the Second World War,
                    but in 1997 a full-size copy of the shrine was made, now stored in Polotsk.</p>
